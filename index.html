<p class="article">The pyramids of Teotihuacán have LIQUID MERCURY inside them.

 The mystery of the ancient pyramids of Teotihuacán increased in 2015 when in the latest discoveries of Teotihuacán made by a group of archaeologists, they reserved great surprises that could not be explained and transformed the case into an unsolved mystery, more than it already was place.

 Liquid mercury was discovered beneath the Teotihuacan pyramid of the sun, as well as a room with a layer of stone, followed by another of mica and then another of stone.  Liquid mercury was placed there by ancient civilization for some unknown reason, but it was even stranger to find caves whose walls were filled with pyrite (a shiny golden mineral that could be a conductor of electricity).  In the same space, golden balls of a strange material were discovered.  It is not known how they worked or for what.

 Liquid mercury, mica and golden spheres were the latest discoveries at Teotihuacán in 2015, but it is shocking that only 10% has been excavated from the deposit.  We miss exploring 90% of Teotihuacán and I'm sure that when everything has been excavated and investigated, the surprises will be even bigger.  It is believed that the great mystery of the pyramid is that it functioned (like others, for example, the Great Pyramid) as a Power Station.

 We have not yet managed to decipher the mysteries of the pyramids of Teotihuacán or those of Egypt (Giza).  These advanced societies used technology and mathematics, which matched the pyramids and their measurements with maps of the solar system.  Those who built Teotihuacán had knowledge of the solar system, something the ancient inhabitants could not have had.

<p class="article">The Zulu people, one of the largest ethnic groups in South Africa, have a rich history marked by significant contributions to the region's development. Their society is renowned for its intricate social structures and the formidable skill of its warriors. By the early 19th century, the Zulu had begun to consolidate power under the leadership of Shaka Zulu, a visionary and strategic leader.

Shaka Zulu, born around 1787, transformed the Zulu kingdom through innovative military tactics and social reforms. He introduced new weapons, such as the short stabbing spear (assegai), and implemented rigorous training programs for his warriors. Shaka's strategies emphasized discipline, speed, and efficiency, enabling the Zulu to outmaneuver and overpower rival tribes. His leadership and reforms unified the Zulu people, turning them into a dominant force in southern Africa.

Under Shaka's reign, the Zulu kingdom expanded significantly, incorporating numerous neighboring tribes and territories. This period, known as the Mfecane or "crushing," was marked by widespread upheaval and migration as the Zulu empire grew. Shaka's influence extended beyond military conquest; he also restructured the Zulu social system, enhancing the cohesion and stability of his kingdom.

<p class="article">"Mysterious Girl" is the second overall single and third British

Peter Andre's second studio album, Natural 1996. The song was written by Glen Goldsmith, Philip Jackson, Ollie Jacobs and Andre, and produced by Jacobs & Mubs. It features guest vocals from Caribbean rapper Bubbler Ranx. It was first released as a single by Melodian Records in Australia on 14 August 1995 and was issued in the United Kingdom the same year, but it was not until a re-release in 1996 that the song became a commercial success there. The accompanying music video was filmed in Thailand. During its original 1995–1996 release, "Mysterious Girl" peaked at number one in New Zealand and number two in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It was also a top-10 hit in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. On the Eurochart Hot 100, the single reached number 11 in September 1996. In 2004, the song was once again re-released in Ireland and the UK, where it topped the UK Singles Chart following extensive promotion.<br><i>Source link below</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">The Surya Siddhanta, a profound ancient Hindu astronomical treatise, offers remarkably precise celestial calculations that some suggest could only stem from either incredibly sophisticated ancient knowledge or perhaps guidance from extraterrestrial sources. This text details complex mathematical techniques for predicting eclipses and planetary positions, contributing significantly to the fields of astronomy and astrology. How did ancient scholars achieve such accuracy without modern tools, and what might this suggest about their understanding of the cosmos and its origins?<br>

<p class="article">The great mathematician #Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier? It happened despite orders that no harm was to be done to him, at the site of Syracuse (214-212 BC).

“Do not disturb my circles”
These would have been the last words of the Syracuse inventor Archimedes (c 287-212 BC). when after the fall of his city under Roman power, a legionary, of so many who roamed the defeated city, killed him in search of loot.

Archimedes was one of the most famous scientists of the ancient world. He's probably best known for his 'Eureka' shout when he noticed the water level in his bathtub rose when he got in it. Archimedes' greatest contribution to mathematics was his discovery of formulas for areas and volumes of spheres, cylinders, parables and other flat and solid figures. 

The methods he used predicted theories of integration that developed 1800 years later. He was also a pioneer in the science of hydrostatic, the study of pressure and fluid balance. 

The Archimedes screw developed by him as a means to raise water is still used for irrigation purposes today.
This genius died accidentally because there was a warrant to capture him alive.<br>

<p class="article">A captivating discovery straight out of Japan's Heian period (12th century AD) has surfaced! Archaeologists have unearthed an officer's dress sword, a silent testament to a samurai's past.

The sword boasts an ornate handle, hinting at the prestige associated with its owner. The scabbard, even more striking, features a delicate inlay of mother-of-pearl – a luxurious touch that speaks volumes about the status of the samurai who wielded it.

However, the passage of time has taken its toll.  The blade, sadly, is too rusted to be drawn from its sheath. This frozen moment in time sparks our imagination.  Who was the officer who carried this exquisite weapon? Did it witness battles fought with honor, or was it a symbol of authority during peaceful times?

This discovery offers a tangible link to a by gone era in Japanese history.  While the mysteries surrounding the sword remain, its beauty and craftsmanship serve as a window into the lives and culture of the Heian period samurai.<br>

<p class="article">"THE COMMANDER OF THE LOST NINTH ROMAN LEGION"

Quintus Petillius Cerialis was born into a prominent Roman family during the 1st century AD. Little is known about his early life, but he likely received a comprehensive education befitting his status and lineage.

His appointment as commander of the Ninth Legion was likely a testament to his proven track record of success on the battlefield and his reputation as a capable and trusted military leader. Under his command, the Ninth Legion embarked on a series of campaigns to secure Roman control over the frontier, facing formidable challenges and adversaries along the way.

Yet, despite their victories and Cerialis's leadership, one day the Ninth Legion vanished from existence, leaving behind a perplexing mystery that has puzzled historians for centuries. The circumstances surrounding their disappearance remain shrouded in speculation and conjecture, with theories ranging from catastrophic defeat in battle to mysterious relocation or assimilation into local populations.<br>

<div class="quizz" id="d113" style="display:none">
<p class="article">Elon Musk is warning that iPhones might not be allowed at his companies due to Apple's new OpenAI integration announced at WWDC 2024. 

He stated on the X platform that “if Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level", his businesses would ban Apple devices. He mentioned that visitors would need to leave their Apple devices at the door and they would be "stored in a Faraday cage".

In iOS 18, Apple announced that Siri will be able to ask ChatGPT for help if it thinks it can answer a question. Users will be asked for permission to share the question, and if they agree, ChatGPT will provide the answer directly. 

This means users can get ChatGPT's assistance without opening the ChatGPT iOS app. The same applies to photos, PDFs, or other documents users want to send to ChatGPT.

Musk expressed his disbelief in one of his posts, stating, "It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!" 

He further criticized Apple, claiming, "Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river." While Apple may not fully understand how OpenAI operates, technically, it's the user who decides to share their data, not Apple.<br>

<p class="article">Before Teslas and modern electric vehicles, New York City's streets were graced by a silent, eco-friendly fleet of electric taxis in the late 19th century.

In the 1890s, New York City faced a severe pollution problem due to its estimated 150,000 horses. The city's motorized taxicab service, launched on March 27, 1897, offered an innovative solution. These taxis weren't powered by gasoline but by electricity, marking an early chapter in the history of sustainable transportation.

Electric cars, like the Electrobat, crafted by Henry Morris and Pedro Salom in 1894, were more popular than their gasoline counterparts at the dawn of the automotive age. These vehicles were quiet, clean, and easy to drive, unlike the noisy and unreliable gas-powered cars of the time.

The Electrobat, powered by a lead-acid battery, could travel up to 25 miles on a single charge and reach speeds of 15 miles per hour. Morris and Salom devised a battery-swapping system that allowed their taxis to operate continuously, making their service highly efficient and popular, especially among Manhattan's elite.<br>

<p class="article">The Knights Templar, a medieval Christian military order founded in the early 12th century, are widely recognized for their pioneering role in the early banking system. Initially established to protect pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land, the Templars quickly expanded their influence across Europe and the Middle East.

By leveraging their extensive network of commanderies and castles, the Templars developed a sophisticated financial infrastructure. Pilgrims and merchants could deposit their valuables at one Templar location and receive a letter of credit, which could be redeemed at another location. This innovative system provided a safer alternative to carrying large sums of money over long and perilous journeys.

The Templars' financial services extended beyond safeguarding valuables and issuing letters of credit. They also engaged in lending, managed estates, and facilitated international trade. Their financial acumen and extensive network laid the groundwork for modern banking practices.<br>

<p class="article">Female gladiators in ancient Rome, referred to as "gladiatrices," were exceptional and intriguing figures who challenged the traditional roles and expectations of women in Roman society. Although less common than male gladiators, these women participated in the bloody spectacles that were central to Roman entertainment and political life. 

Gladiatrices fought in arenas such as the Colosseum, equipped with weapons and armor similar to that of male gladiators. They battled against each other or sometimes faced wild animals, drawing large crowds fascinated by the spectacle of women warriors. These events were not everyday occurrences but were special attractions that highlighted festivals or games sponsored by Roman elites to gain political favor or celebrate significant occasions.<br>

<p class="article">Julius Caesar, one of history's most influential figures, lived during a transformative period in Roman history. Born in 100 BCE, Caesar rose through the ranks of Roman politics to become a general, statesman, and eventual dictator of the Roman Republic. His military conquests, particularly in Gaul, and his central role in the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire, have cemented his place in history.

However, Caesar's personal life was as dynamic and complex as his public one. His marriages to Cornelia, Pompeia, and Calpurnia are well-documented, along with his infamous affair with Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt. These relationships highlight Caesar's powerful connections with influential women of his time.

Yet, ancient sources suggest that Caesar's affections were not confined to women. Roman historians like Suetonius and Plutarch provide accounts hinting at Caesar's bis*xuality. The most notable example is his relationship with King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia. This relationship was so prominent that it became the subject of ridicule and political satire, with rumors suggesting that Caesar was the "Queen of Bithynia."<br>

Users must verify income and commit to seeking marriage. 

Backed by a $1.28 million investment from the city, the app requires ID, income certification, and relationship status confirmation. 

Applicants must fill out 15 categories of personal data, including height and occupation, and undergo a mandatory interview. 

Tokyo officials aim to address the challenge of finding marriage partners by endorsing the app, as Japan's birth and marriage rates continue to plummet. 

Elon Musk expressed support, highlighting the urgency of addressing population decline.<br>

<p class="article">This is Lomas Rishi Cave, one of several man-made Barabar Caves.

The Barabar Hill Caves (Hindi बराबर, Barābar) are the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India, dating from the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE), some with Ashokan inscriptions, located in the Makhdumpur region of Jehanabad district, Bihar, India, 24 km (15 mi) north of Gaya.

The cave of Lomas Rishi is probably the most famous of the caves of Barabar, because of its beautifully carved door. It is on the southern side of Barabar granite hill, and is adjacent to Sudama cave, which is on the left. Lomas Rishi consists of two rooms: a rectangular room measuring 9.86x5.18m, and a circular, semi-hemispherical room 5m in diameter, which is accessed from the rectangular room by a narrow rectangular passage.<br>

<p class="article">In ancient times, the Babylonians introduced a unique numerical system centered around 60, reshaping the foundations of timekeeping and geometry. This innovative approach led to the division of time into 60 seconds per minute and the definition of circles in 360 degrees, profoundly influencing our modern understanding of these concepts. Exploring the motivations behind the Babylonians' adoption of the sexagesimal system reveals intriguing connections between their mathematical principles and the evolution of mathematical thought throughout history. Unraveling this historical narrative sheds light on the enduring impact of ancient mathematical innovations on the mathematical frameworks that guide our everyday lives today.<br>

Born in 624 AD, Wu Zetian started as a concubine to Emperor Taizong. After his passing, she returned to court under Emperor Gaozong and rose to Empress Consort through intelligence and political skill.

Upon Gaozong's passing, she effectively controlled the empire, eventually declaring herself Emperor in 690 AD. Her reign saw significant reforms, promoting meritocracy, supporting Buddhism, and strengthening central power. Despite controversies, Wu Zetian remains a powerful and effective ruler in Chinese history.<br>

Queen Amina of Zazzau, born around 1533 to King Nikatau and Queen Bakwa Turunku, showed an early interest in military matters and demonstrated exceptional leadership skills. She trained with the warriors of Zazzau, earning respect for her abilities. Following her father's passing, her brother Karama became king, but Amina played a significant role in military campaigns. Upon Karama's passing after a ten-year reign, Amina ascended to the throne, marking the start of an era of significant military expansion and conquest for Zazzau.

During her reign, which began around 1576, Queen Amina led numerous successful military campaigns, expanding Zazzau's territory to its greatest extent, covering much of what is now northern Nigeria and beyond. Her legacy, documented through oral traditions and the chronicles of historians like Muhammed Bello, often blends historical facts with folklore, adding to her legendary status. 

One such legend tells her taking an enemy soldier after a battle, spending the night with him, and then k!lling him the next morning to ensure he could tell no stories.<br>

<p class="article">In medieval times, the caltrop was a simple yet effective weapon used to impede the advance of enemy cavalry or infantry. It was typically made of metal and had four sharp points arranged so that one point always faced upward when thrown on the ground. 

This made it difficult for horses or soldiers to advance without risking injury to their feet. Caltrops were commonly used in battles and as a defensive measure to protect fortifications or camps. Were used in WW2 and still used in various forms to this day! The design hasn't really changed, this one is believed to be Roman.<br>

She explained that she had turned down an offer from Sam Altman to use her voice for the AI, yet a similar voice was still used. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, denied copying her voice but agreed to stop the demo.<br>

<p class="article">The narrative recounted by Diodorus of Sicily in the 1st century BC unveils the Ethiopians' belief in their lineage from the Egyptians, pointing to an intimate historical bond between these regions. This connection is exemplified through the adoption of Egyptian practices such as the veneration of kings and the development of art and writing. The amalgamation of these customs within the regions now recognized as Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia, once collectively termed "Abyssinia," is a testament to a longstanding tradition of cultural interaction. Reflecting on this ancient viewpoint offers a fresh perspective on how the civilizations in these areas are shaped today by their shared past.<br>

It was later covered by American singer Johnny Nash on his 1972 album I Can See Clearly Now. The following year, Marley and the Wailers re-recorded the song for their album Catch a fire 
The band performed "Stir It Up" on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973 during their first trip to the UK, singing live over a Chris Blackwell overdubbed backing track.
"Stir It Up" was the first Marley-written song to be successful outside Jamaica. Another tune written by Bob Marley, "I Shot The Sheriff", was covered by Eric Clapton on the album 461 Ocean Boulevard, July 1974. Marley's first international hit recorded by him, "No Woman, No Cry", was released on the Bob Marley and the Wailers album Live!, December 1975.<br><i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">Hit 'Em Up" is a diss track by American rapper 2Pac, featuring the Outlawz. It is the B-side to the single "How Do U Want It", released on June 4, 1996. The song's lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chiefly Shakur's former friend turned rival, The Notorious B.I.G. (also referred to colloquially as Biggie Smalls). The song was recorded at Can Am Studios in 1996. A previous version of the song was recorded in October 1995.
Reporter Chuck Philips, who interviewed Shakur at Can Am, described the song as "a caustic anti–East Coast jihad in which the rapper threatens to eliminate Biggie, Puff, and a slew of Bad Boy artists and other New York acts." The song was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny "J". The video, itself described as infamous, includes impersonations of Biggie, Puffy and M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Kim.
"Hit 'Em Up" had a large role in exacerbating the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. Following its release, the East Coast rappers insulted in the song responded through tracks of their own. The controversy surrounding the song is due in part to Shakur's murder in a drive-by-shooting only three months after its release.
The song is widely regarded as among the greatest diss tracks ever recorded, as well as one of the most savage and brutal.<br><i>Source link below</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">Kush was the “Land of the Bow" 🎯

Hunters using bows and arrows appear in Nubian rock art as early as the Neolithic period and hunting provided subsistence for Nubians throughout much of their history. Some of Nubia's most important trade products, like animal skins and ivory, came from the hunt.

The skill of Nubian archers made them valued members in the military forces of other lands. Egyptian texts as early as 2400 BC note Nubians in Kemet armies. Representations of Nubian warriors appear in some tombs, reliefs, and paintings in all periods of Kemet history.

Nubian archers were so skilled and so accurate that they could hit enemies in the eye and blind them without killing them, they defended themselves against the Egyptians, Romans and Arabs invaders.

At one point Kemet was conquered by the Nubians from 750 B.C to 712 B.C. and for a period a line of Nubian pharaohs, known as the 25th Dynasty of Kemet, ruled both lands.<br>

<p class="article">When Alexander the Great got sick in 323 BC, his generals asked him who should be the next leader. He said, "To the strongest," which led to confusion. After his death, his generals started fighting each other for power. This struggle, known as the Wars of the Diadochi, lasted for 50 years. The empire broke into several smaller kingdoms, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic Period, where Greek culture mixed with others.<br>

<p class="article">Once upon a time, in the vast cosmos, numerous extraterrestrial species made contact with our planet. Many governments worldwide have kept highly classified records documenting these encounters, detailing the physical attributes, planetary origins, and histories of these beings. To many other extraterrestrial species, humans are considered the "new kids on the block," and Earth is seen as an abandoned seed colony.

Spiritual mediums on Earth have the ability to communicate with higher astral extraterrestrial beings, often described as peaceful and angelic. In contrast, malevolent lower astral beings, often called demons, manifest in both physical and spiritual forms within evil dimensional frequencies. Like humanity, extraterrestrial beings range from good to evil, a duality that is important to understand as we explore our cosmic kin.

Among the many known extraterrestrial species, the Arcturians stand out. Inhabiting the 11th dimension, they are ancient, wise, and angelic, believed to be the first species given the gift of life in our galaxy. They are about 5-6 feet tall, with beautiful blue skin and large, perceptive eyes. Their advanced technology and peaceful nature make them ideal members of the Galactic Federation of Worlds.

The Grays, originating from the Zeti Reticuli star system, are another well-known species. They are often perceived as malevolent due to their abductions of humans for genetic material, aimed at creating hybrids to save their race.

The Annunaki, or Sirians from the Sirius B star system, are believed to have engineered our ancestors and are depicted in ancient Mesopotamian and Sumerian civilizations. They are technologically advanced but still spiritually evolving, living for thousands of years.

The Draconian Reptilians, from the Draco star system, are considered the most malevolent. They are ancient, powerful, and feed off low frequencies, fear, and death, making them a significant threat to other species.

The Pleiadians, resembling blonde Vikings, are peaceful and spiritually advanced, often associated with energy manipulation, healing, and interstellar travel. They are believed to have seeded life on Earth along with the Arcturians and Lyrans.

The Sassani are human-gray hybrids living in the 5th dimension, known for their peaceful nature and advanced spirituality. They were created to overcome the reproductive issues faced by the Grays.

Lyrans, originating from the Lyra constellation, are a diverse group with different physical appearances and are involved in the ongoing cosmic struggle against the Draconians.

Lastly, the Carians, the first beings incarnated in the universe, developed bodies resembling birds and created the Draconian Reptilians. They are intellectual and courteous, focusing on science, exploration, and philosophy.

Throughout history, a cosmic conflict has raged between benevolent and malevolent forces, reflecting the struggle between good and evil. Our mission is to overcome darkness and return to the light, promoting knowledge, unity, and enlightenment among humanity. If you enjoyed this story, following the page Ancient Knowledge 2024.<br>

<p class="article">In ancient Egypt, the pharaohs were believed to be gods on Earth, wielding immense power and wisdom. The true origins of these divine rulers lay with the Anunnaki, who integrated themselves into Egyptian society, guiding the civilization's growth and prosperity.

Ra, the sun god, was actually Ra'kesh, an Anunnaki scientist who harnessed solar energy to power the pyramids and other monumental structures. Isis and Osiris were also Anunnaki, revered for their medical knowledge and ability to extend life. They established a dynasty of pharaohs, each infused with Anunnaki knowledge and technology.

The most significant artifact left by the Anunnaki was the Eye of Horus, a device capable of granting visions of the future and healing the sick. This device was hidden within the Great Pyramid, protected by traps and riddles only a true descendant of the Anunnaki could solve.

In modern times, Egyptologist Dr. Nefertari Saad discovers a hidden passage in the Great Pyramid. Her findings lead her to the Eye of Horus, awakening it after millennia of dormancy. The device projects a message from Ra'kesh, revealing the true history of the Anunnaki pharaohs and their intentions for humanity.

Dr. Saad, with the help of geneticist Dr. Amir Khalid, uncovers that she is a direct descendant of the Anunnaki, capable of unlocking the full potential of the Eye of Horus. As she learns to use the device, she faces threats from those who wish to exploit its power. Dr. Saad must protect the legacy of the Anunnaki while using their knowledge to heal and unite a divided world.<br>

<div class="quizz" id="d83" style="display:none">
<p class="article">In the ancient texts of Genesis, a mysterious tale unfolds where the "sons of God" descended to Earth and mingled with the "daughters of men." This union produced a hybrid race known as the Nephilim, or "fallen ones," who were described as giants, mighty beings towering between 8 and 15 feet tall. This narrative isn't confined to the Bible; it echoes through Sumerian legends, where gods consorted with humans, resulting in giant offspring. 

Mythology across cultures is replete with stories of giants. To modern eyes, these tales can be reinterpreted. Imagine replacing the word "angel" with "extraterrestrial." At the dawn of time, extraterrestrials might have interbred with humans, giving rise to these colossal beings. As geneticists continue to decode the human genome, could they uncover evidence of these ancient giants? Could our DNA hold traces of a missing link to these enormous beings from another world?

Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that our ancestors' texts, such as early Judaic writings, offer profound insights. For instance, Kabbalistic traditions describe the first man, Adam, not as a regular human but as a giant. This ancient race, the Adamic race, might have been of a greater stature than we are today. Is this merely symbolic, or does it hint at a literal truth? Was Adam a giant, and are we, his descendants, from a race of giants?

Mainstream science, grounded in Darwinistic views, often challenges these notions. Yet, mythology and ancient texts persistently speak of giants. Archaeological findings, like enormous bones, occasionally surface, only to be disputed. Despite skepticism, the possibility remains that giants did exist, born from the union of extraterrestrials and humans.

Megalithic structures, shared religious traditions, and sporadic discoveries of large human remains may be the remnants of a lost civilization of giants. These beings could have played a significant role in the creation of humankind. Perhaps one day, conclusive evidence will emerge, revealing that within the mythological tales of our ancestors lies the true history of the human race.<br>

<p class="article">Shaka Zulu established the Zulu Empire and revolutionized warfare in Southern Africa in the early 19th Century.  Shaka was born in 1787. His father, Senzangakhona, was a minor chief of one of the Zulu-speaking clans and his mother, Nandi, was daughter of Chief Mbhengi of the rival clan.  Shaka’s birth was considered a sin because his parents were from different clans. Due to pressure from tribal leaders Shaka’s parents separated resulting in the exile of him and his mother from his father’s clan. Shaka’s mother returned to her Elangeni where she was shunned.  Consequently, her son Shaka was harassed, tormented, and neglected.

As Shaka grew older, he recalled with anger his tormenting by Elangeni members.  Upon reaching manhood he deserted the Elangeni and became affiliated with the Mthethwa clan. He served as a warrior for six years under the reign of Dingiswayo, the Mthethwa’s chief. Dingiswayo was impressed by Shaka’s courage and endurance.  Shaka remained with the Mthethwa until he learned of the death of his father, Senzangakhona, in 1816.

Shaka claimed his father’s chieftaincy with military assistance from Dingiswayo.  With his experience learned from the Mthethwa, he transformed his clan’s military from a largely ceremonial force into a powerful army capable of both defense and aggression.

In 1818, Shaka’s mentor Dingiswayo was assassinated by Zwide, the chief of the Ndwandwe clan.  Shaka sought revenge and received it in 1820 with the Zulu’s victory over the Ndwandwe in the Battle of Mhlatuze River.  Shaka then set out to forge the various Zulu-speaking clans into a powerful empire.  As he incorporated rival groups, the Zulu Empire’s population reached an estimated 250,000 and his state emerged as the largest in the history of Southern Africa.  In 1827, at the height of his power, Shaka could order into the field of battle over 50,000 warriors and controlled most of the area that is now the modern state of South Africa.

Shaka’s actions became simultaneously more tyrannical, ruthless and bizarre as power concentrated in his hands.  In 1827 at the height of his power, his mother, Nandi, died.  Anger over her death and over her (and his) treatment at the hands of the Elangeni led him to order the massacre of thousands of tribal members.  His brutal treatment of his own Army nearly led to its mutiny.

In 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana.  Dingane assumed control of the Empire which lasted another half century before finally being crushed by the British Army.<br>

<p class="article">JOHN CARTER 2 (2024) Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins 

John Carter is a 2012 American science fiction action-adventure film directed by Andrew Stanton, written by Stanton, Mark Andrews, and Michael Chabon, and based on A Princess of Mars, the first book in the Barsoom series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Produced by Jim Morris, Colin Wilson and Lindsey Collins, it stars Taylor Kitsch in the title role, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds, Dominic West, James Purefoy and Willem Dafoe. It chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of John Carter and his attempts to mediate civil unrest amongst the warring kingdoms of Barsoom.

Several attempts to adapt the Barsoom series had been made since the 1930s by various major studios and producers. Most of these efforts ultimately stalled in development hell. In the late-2000s, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort to adapt Burroughs' works to film, after an abandoned venture in the 1980s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the screen rights from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became the new film's director in 2009. It was his live-action debut, after his directorial work for Disney on the Pixar animated films Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Filming began in November 2009, with principal photography underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July. Michael Giacchino, who scored many Pixar films, composed the music. Like Pixar's Brave that same year, the film is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs.

It was released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on March 9, 2012, marking the centennial of the titular character's first appearance. It was presented in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visuals, Giacchino's score, and the action sequences, but criticism of the characterization and plot. It failed at the North American box office, but set an opening-day record in Russia. It grossed $284 million at the worldwide box office, resulting in a $200 million writedown for Disney, becoming one of the biggest box office bombs in history. With a total cost of $350 million, including an estimated production budget of $263 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Due to its poor performance, Disney cancelled plans for Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, the rest of the trilogy Stanton had planned.

John Carter's failure has been blamed on its promotion, which has been called "one of the worst marketing campaigns in movie history". Critics focus on the decision to remove the words "Princess" and "Mars" from the title out of fear of alienating young men and women, leaving prospective audiences to try to deduce what the film was about from trailers and ads that were similarly uninformative about its characters and plot, its place in the development of science fiction, and who had made it. The images they showed also seemed derivative of works such as Star Wars, Dune and Avatar that were themselves informed by the Barsoom stories. Other critics have argued the film was doomed from the start since those works had so thoroughly appropriated the source material as to ensure that modern audiences would see John Carter as unoriginal. The movie is available for streaming today on the movie channel, follow the link.<br>

<p class="article">The "Buffalo Soldiers" were African American soldiers who served in the United States Army in the late 1800s.

The nickname "Buffalo Soldiers" was given to them by Native American tribes, particularly the Cheyenne, who admired their fighting skills and bravery in battle.

The nickname was a reference to their dark, curly hair, which was said to resemble the fur of the buffalo, and to their fierce fighting ability, which was likened to that of the buffalo.

The 10th Cavalry Regiment was the first all-African American regiment in the U.S. Army, formed in 1866 after the Civil War.

They were sent to the western frontier to help protect settlers, miners, and stagecoaches from hostile Native American tribes.

Despite facing discrimination and segregation within the army and in society, the Buffalo Soldiers proved themselves to be skilled and effective soldiers, earning a reputation for their bravery and endurance in harsh and dangerous conditions.

They inspired Bob Marley's Reggae Classic Buffalo Soldier.<br>

<p class="article">In 400 BCE, the ancient Persians created the world's first ever refrigerator. The Persian word for fridge – Yakhchal – translates as ice pit, which is very much how the modern day fridge started out.

The Persians settled primarily across the Iranian plateau and were established by the 1st millennium BCE. First developed by the Persians around 400 BC, the Yakhchāl is an ancient type of ice house that functions as an evaporative cooler, used to store ice for use in the summer, as well as for food storage. The one in the picture is the oldest one still standing in Iran and is 400 years old.<br>

<p class="article">KING MOSHOESHOE I!
 King Moshoeshoe I, founder of Lesotho reigned from 1822 to his death in 1870, during a period of immense tumult in southern Africa. He waged one of the most effective resistance efforts to colonialism (from the Dutch Boer settlers and British Empire) over many decades, as well as to Shaka’s military consolidation of what became Zulu Kingdom in the 1820s.

His name was originally a nickname derived from a poem he wrote as a youth, a braggadocio-filled anthem to farm animal theft that could put most hip-hop moguls to shame. From the poorly sourced Wikipedia version of the story:

During his youth, he was very brave and once organised a cattle raid against Ramonaheng and captured several herds. As was the tradition, he composed a poem praising himself where, amongst the words he used to refer to himself, said he was “like a razor which has shaved all Ramonaheng’s beards”, referring to his successful raid. In Sesotho language, a razor makes a “shoe…shoe…” sound, and after that he was affectionately called Moshoeshoe: “the shaver”.

1.He founded his own all-new clan at age 34. Presumably on the strength of his charisma, diplomatic flair, and cattle-rustling skills. This clan established a settlement in a location that could withstand Zulu assaults. His original clan eventually grew to be Lesotho and environs.

2.He never lost a major battle!He ruled for 48 years against a colonial onslaught. Many native rulers in Africa were unable to maintain such a strong level of sovereignty and control in their domains during the period.

3.He united the various Sotho people into a Basotho nation through a combination of battle followed by compassionate diplomacy (rather than subjugation through conquest).

4.He was very willing to mess with the Boers as they tried to invade. 

5.He would give them fair conditions for maintaining peaceful coexistence and then beat them back when they rebelled.<br>

<p class="article">Romain Virgo, born 24 January 1990, is a Jamaican singer, specializing in the lovers rock style of reggae music, and a past competitor in the local music competition Rising Stars. Virgo hails from Stepney in Saint Ann Parish. As a young boy growing up in rural Saint Ann, Virgo emulated his cousin Bryan Art, an established singer and musician who specializes in Lover's Rock and Roots Reggae. At Aabuthnott Gallimore High School he sang on the school choir, with which he participated in the television choir contest All Together Sing in 2006. As a solo singer he won the Digicel Rising Stars competition in 2007, two months before his graduation from high school. At age 17, he was the youngest contestant to ever win top prize at the competition, which included a JA$1,000,000 prize (the equivalent of 6656 euros) and a recording contract with Greensleeves Records. A few weeks after winning the competition, Virgo met Donovan Germain who produced his first hit record "Mi Caan Sleep" on the Penthouse label. Several hit singles followed, including "Wanna Go Home", "Live Mi Life", and "Alton's Medley". In June 2010, VP Records released his debut self-titled album. After winning the Digicel competition, Virgo performed at dances and stageshows, including Rebel Salute, Passa Passa, and Weddy Weddy. In the autumn of 2010, he joined fellow artists Capleton and Munga on a tour of the United States. In addition to his music career, Virgo pursued his bachelor's degree at the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in Kingston, majoring in voice and minoring in keyboard. In 2014 his cover version of Sam Smith's "Stay With Me" topped the charts in several Caribbean countries.[8] Virgo's 2018 album Lovesick gave him his first number one album on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart.<br><i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">Adidja Azim Palmer, born 7 January 1976, better known as Vybz Kartel, is a Jamaican dancehall deejay. Among his various nicknames, he is referred to as Worl' Boss or Teacha. As summarized by Rolling Stone, he "attained folk-hero status in Jamaica with provocative lyrics, and a mischievous public persona", and "few have captivated [the dancehall] audience – or offended the sensibilities of its detractors – as consistently and thoroughly as Kartel." Kartel's singles include "Romping Shop" (2009), "Dancehall Hero" (2010), and "Summer Time" (2011). Having collaborated with a number of hip hop and R&B artists such as Major Lazer, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Digga D, Missy Elliot, Unknown T and Alison Hinds. He has also been credited as an inspiration for the dancehall-infused work of a number of Western artists, including Drake, who has cited Kartel as being one of his "biggest inspirations".
In 2014, Kartel was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his associate Clive "Lizard" Williams. The conviction was quashed on March 14, 2024 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who cited juror misconduct and declared that the Jamaican Court of Appeal had to decide if a retrial would take place, the decision of which will take place starting on June 10. Kartel often released new music despite his imprisonment, having released over 50 new songs in 2016 alone. His hit song "Fever" was certified gold in June 2020. Palmer started his career as a teenager in 1993 with his first recording "Love Fat Woman", which he released on Alvin Reid's label "One Heart" using the moniker "Adi Banton", an homage to Buju Banton. Palmer was later part of the three-member group "Vybz kartel", keeping the name for himself after the group split up. While still a member of the group, he claims to have written nearly 30 songs, including "Gal Clown". He eventually became a protege of Bounty Killer.<br><i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">In "Drunken Master" (1978), Jackie Chan stars as Wong Fei-hung, a mischievous young martial artist known for his rebellious behavior and lack of discipline. Under the direction of Yuen Woo-ping, Chan's portrayal of Wong Fei-hung showcases his exceptional talent for combining physical comedy with intricate martial arts choreography. The film marks a significant departure from the traditional heroic martial arts characters, presenting Chan's character as flawed but endearing.

The plot revolves around Wong Fei-hung's transformation under the tutelage of Beggar So (Yuen Siu-tien), a master of the "Drunken Boxing" style. Initially resistant to the rigorous and unorthodox training methods, Wong eventually embraces the unique fighting style, which mimics the unpredictable and erratic movements of a drunken person. Chan's performance is marked by his agility, precision, and ability to infuse humor into his fight scenes, making the combat both entertaining and technically impressive.

"Drunken Master" was a turning point in Jackie Chan's career, establishing his trademark blend of comedy and action. The film's success not only propelled Chan to international stardom but also influenced the martial arts genre by introducing a more lighthearted and relatable hero, deviating from the stoic and serious martial arts protagonists of the time.<br>

<p class="article">This image depicts the multi-level underground city carved deep beneath the earth in Derinkuyu, Turkey.  Imagine entire communities living and thriving underground!  While the exact origins of Derinkuyu remain unclear, some believe it was built 10,000 - 12,000 years ago.

The city boasted multiple levels, storehouses, stables, and even a sophisticated ventilation system.  It could have housed as many as 60,000 people!  Why would people build an entire city underground?

Some theories suggest Derinkuyu was a refuge, a place to hide from invaders or natural disasters.  Others believe it was part of a larger network of underground cities throughout the region.

The reasons behind Derinkuyu's creation may forever be a mystery, but it serves as a reminder of the ingenuity and adaptability of ancient civilizations.  What do you think Derinkuyu was used for? Was Derinkuyu a hidden city built for protection, or something more else? what are your thoughts?<br>

<p class="article">How did the British royal family become"royal"?
And we are royal guard ❤️

Their first traceable ancestor was a Viking named Rollo in what's now Normandy, France. He was granted lands by the French King to prevent him from raiding France and todefend against other Viking raids.

In 1066, Rollo's great-great-grandson, Duke William of Normandy, sailed across the English Channel from Franceto England with an army of knights. He fought and defeated King Harold, then crowned himself the king of England and became known to history as William the Conqueror. Hebecame the first English king from the line that still reignstoday, which continues on down to King Charles. After hisconquest, William took all the land and rented it out to hisfriends, who then subleased it to others. So basically, to beroyal, win a war, kill your enemies, declare your "kingdom,"make up rules, and kill anyone who disagrees.<br>

<p class="article">A Spartan Hoplite during the Persian Wars (499-449 BC) typically wore either a heavier bronze cuirass armor or linothrax, a thick fabric-based armor as depicted here. The "Lambda" (an inverted English "V") symbolized Sparta as Laconia or Lacedemonia and was painted on their bronze shields. This practice is first recorded in literary sources from the 420s. Xenophon and Thucydides provide great insights into these periods. A common question is whether Leonidas and his 300 were bare-chested. The answer is no. As the King's elite bodyguard, they were heavily armed and armored. The arm guard shown in the drawing is incorrect; it's a bit of Hollywood hype. 

In 392 BC, Spartans and many Hellenic City-States began to forgo torso armor due to the "Iphicratean Reforms." They fought bare-chested but kept a variant of the famous blood-red cloak. This change was in response to evolving warfare, which required faster movement that armor hindered. They would have been bare-chested, wearing a Corinthian-style helmet, cloak, leg greaves, sword, spear, and shield, while still proudly sporting their long flowing hair as part of their military legacy. Spartans never used archers, as they considered it cowardly to kill without seeing their opponent's eyes.<br>

<p class="article">The Benin Moat (Edo: Iyanuwo), also known as the Benin Iya, or Walls of Benin, are a series of massive earthworks encircling Benin City in Nigeria's Edo State. These moats have deep historical roots, with evidence suggesting their existence before the establishment of the Oba monarchy. Construction began around 800 AD and continued until 1460 AD, involving large-scale manual labour and the repurposing of earth from the inner ditch to build the outer berm. Some traditional sources claim that these earthworks spanned approximately 16,000 kilometres (9,900 mi), enclosing about 6,500 square kilometres (2,500 sq mi) of land.The Benin Moat served as defensive structures, with steep banks and a berm to deter invaders. Access to the city was controlled through nine gates. Today, remnants of the moats can still be found in Benin City, although urbanisation and land disputes pose challenges to their preservation. Recognised for their historical significance, the Benin Moat was added as an extension to the existing World Heritage Site of the Royal Palaces of Abomey in 1995 (though still awaiting official recognition by UNESCO), and was acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1974 as one of the world's largest man-made structures by length, second only to China's Great Wall. It was described by Olfert Dapper in his book Description of Africa in 1668 as the Great Walls of Benin.

<p class="article">All you need to know about this movie Apocalypto;

"Apocalypto," directed by Mel Gibson and released in 2006, is an epic historical adventure film set in the late Maya civilization before Spanish colonization. The story follows Jaguar Paw, a young hunter whose idyllic village life is violently disrupted when a group of raiders attacks, capturing villagers for slavery and human sacrifice.

Jaguar Paw, portrayed by Rudy Youngblood, is a resourceful and determined protagonist. During the brutal journey to the raiders' city, he manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son in a pit. As his captors prepare to sacrifice him, a sudden solar eclipse saves his life. Seizing the opportunity, Jaguar Paw escapes, leading to an intense chase through the dense Mesoamerican rainforest.

The film is notable for its authentic portrayal of the Maya civilization, using Yucatec Maya dialogue and meticulously crafted sets and costumes. Gibson emphasizes the culture’s complexity and brutality, depicting both the splendor of its cities and the savagery of its rituals.

"Apocalypto" is renowned for its visceral action sequences and breathtaking cinematography, capturing the lush, perilous jungle environment. The narrative is a relentless survival tale, emphasizing themes of resilience, family, and the struggle against oppression. 

Despite its critical and box office success, "Apocalypto" sparked controversy for its depiction of Mayan culture, with some critics arguing it sensationalizes violence and distorts historical facts. Nevertheless, it remains a gripping, visually stunning film that offers a raw, intense glimpse into a pivotal historical moment.<br>

"My girlfriend left me for a guy that had a C63. I don't care and I don't feel embarrassed and that's why I am telling you. When we were still datîng, I used to tell her every morning that I wanted a C63. One day, she woke up and said to me "Babe, I need $4k for my hair." And I was like why don't you ask your parents. The next day in the evening, she came with her new guy in a C63 to tell me that she's breaking up with me. I almost crîed but I didn't because real men don't cry for women in public. Then the guy looked at me and said, "broke men have no business near love." Then she came up to me and was like I am so much done with you, these are your house keys, i love you but you're brôke. This girl used to ride me in bed and I don't wanna call her name but she is regreting today." Casper Nyovest

<p class="article">The history of dreadlocks can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, India, and Greece. In Egypt, dreadlocks were worn by the priests of the god Ptah, and they were also worn by members of the Rastafarian religion in #Jamaica.
Dreadlocks became a popular hairstyle among the Rastafarians in the 1930s. The Rastafarian movement was founded in Jamaica and is based on a combination of Christian and African spiritual beliefs. The Rastafarians believe that the hair is a symbol of the strength and vitality of their African heritage, and they wear dreadlocks as a way to express this belief.

In addition to its religious significance, dreadlocks have also become a symbol of rebellion and counterculture. During the 1960s and 1970s, dreadlocks were popular among hippies and other groups who rejected mainstream society.
Throughout different cultures, people have worn locs for various reasons. For instance, the Maasai warriors of Africa have been known to wear long, thin, red dreadlocks which they dye with red root extracts or red ochre. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, there are children born with naturally locked hair who are referred to as "Dada" by the Yoruba in Nigeria.

The Rastafari movement sees dreadlocks as a symbol of the Lion of Judah, which is sometimes featured on the Ethiopian flag.
 The followers of the Rastafari believe that Haile Selassie is directly related to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through their son Menelik I. They were inspired to wear dreadlocks by the Nazarites mentioned in the Bible.

Today, dreadlocks are worn by people of all races and backgrounds, and they have become a popular hairstyle in many parts of the world. While they still hold religious and cultural significance for some, many people simply wear them as a personal expression of style.

Despite their growing popularity, dreadlocks have also been the subject of controversy and discrimination. In some workplaces and schools, they have been banned, and some people have faced discrimination because of their hairstyle.

Overall, the history of dreadlocks is a complex and multifaceted one, with deep roots in ancient civilizations and a continuing significance in modern culture.<br>

<p class="article">Meta's Chief AI Scientist, Yann LeCun, predicts that smartphones will become obsolete in 10-15 years, replaced by augmented reality (AR) glasses. LeCun, who is Meta’s VP and Chief AI Scientist, envisions AR glasses taking over, enabling us to interact with smart assistants instead of using apps directly. Meta’s Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are already in line with this future vision.

This change is expected to be driven by advancements in AI, suggesting that we’ll soon depend on AR glasses for our daily tasks. Devices like the Humane AI pin and Rabbit R1 are examples of this emerging trend.<br>

<p class="article">The Anunnaki Enigma" delves into the mysterious realm of ancient Mesopotamian mythology, focusing on the enigmatic beings known as the Anunnaki. Revered as gods by the Sumerians, Akkadians, and Babylonians, the Anunnaki were believed to have descended from the heavens to Earth, shaping the course of human history in profound ways.

According to ancient texts such as the "Enuma Elish" and the "Atrahasis Epic," the Anunnaki played pivotal roles in the creation of humanity, the establishment of civilization, and the development of early cultures. Their origins, however, remain shrouded in mystery, with some interpretations suggesting extraterrestrial or otherworldly origins.

One of the central enigmas surrounding the Anunnaki revolves around their purported advanced knowledge and technology. From the construction of monumental structures like the ziggurats to their alleged genetic manipulation of humans, the Anunnaki are often depicted as possessing capabilities far beyond those of ancient civilizations.

In modern times, the concept of the Anunnaki has become intertwined with fringe theories such as ancient astronaut theory and conspiracy narratives. Some proponents argue that the Anunnaki continue to influence human affairs, shaping our societal structures, religious beliefs, and technological advancements.<br>

<p class="article">Alexander 3 of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), most commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon. He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia, Central Asia, parts of South Asia, and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to north western India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders. Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, hecampaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia.

In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those at Issus andG augamela; he subsequently overthrew Darius 3 and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between theAdriatic Sea and the Indus River.<br>

<p class="article">The Mali Empire was a powerful West African empire that existed from the 13th to the 17th century. It was located in what is now Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, and parts of Niger and Burkina Faso. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita, a legendary warrior king, in 1230.
The Mali Empire was known for its wealth, which was largely derived from trade. The empire controlled important trade routes that connected West Africa with North Africa and the Mediterranean world. Gold, salt, and other commodities were traded along these routes, making the Mali Empire one of the wealthiest in the world at the time.

The Mali Empire was also known for its vibrant culture and scholarship. The city of Timbuktu, which was located in the heart of the empire, became a major center of Islamic scholarship and learning, and was home to many universities and madrasas. Timbuktu was also known for its libraries, which contained thousands of manuscripts on a wide range of subjects, including science, mathematics, medicine, and literature.

Under the leadership of Sundiata Keita and his successors, the Mali Empire became one of the wealthiest and most powerful empires in Africa. The empire was known for its abundant gold resources, which were used to finance the construction of impressive architecture, such as the famous Great Mosque of Djenné.

The Mali Empire was also known for its thriving trade network, which stretched across the Sahara Desert and into North Africa and the Middle East. Traders would exchange gold, salt, ivory, and slaves for goods such as textiles, spices, and luxury items like silk and ceramics.

Islam was introduced to the Mali Empire in the 11th century, but it wasn’t until the 14th century that it became the dominant religion. Many of the empire’s rulers, including Mansa Musa, were devout Muslims and helped to spread the religion throughout West Africa.
The Mali Empire declined in the 16th century due to internal conflicts, attacks from neighbors.<br>

<p class="article">Leroy Russell Junior, born 4 November 1987, better known by his stage names Tommy Lee and Tommy Lee Sparta, is a Jamaican dancehall artist from Flankers, Montego Bay, Jamaica. Tommy Lee Sparta gained popularity as a member of Adidjahiem Records and the associated Portmore Empire crew under the leadership of Vybz Kartel. He has been a controversial figure in dancehall due to his self-described "Gothic Dancehall" style, which often features dark and Satanist-inspired subject matter. Tommy Lee Sparta began deejaying in late 2007 at Snipa Studios in Flankers, where he recorded his first song, "Spartan Story." During this time, he performed as an opening act for local shows, including several from Portmore artist Vybz Kartel. Kartel, noticing that the artist was receiving positive responses from the crowd, invited him to move to Kingston and become a part of the Portmore Empire, Kartel's music crew. Tommy Lee Sparta, however, was reluctant to leave his family and neighborhood, and declined the offer. According to Tommy Lee Sparta, it wasn't until his performance at Vybz Kartel's Birthday Bash on 7 January 2010 that he decided to take the idea of being a musician seriously, and he soon accepted the offer to become an official member of the Portmore Empire crew. "Warn Dem," released in November 2010, was Tommy Lee Sparta's first recognized hit, based on a riddim by Da Wiz, his original producer from Snipa Studios. The accompanying music video, directed by Dk Konsepp, was also a first for the artist. Tommy Lee Sparta's breakthrough hit came with "Some Bwoy (Link Pon Wi Chain)" on the 2011 So Bad Riddim. However, it wasn't until well after Kartel's arrest and the release of the music video in 2012, under new management from Junior "Heavy-D" Fraser, that the single gained traction. The single worked its way to the number one spot of many of Jamaica's informal music charts, including Pree Dis and Entertainment Report, and the video was in heavy rotation on Caribbean stations such as RETV, Hype TV, and Tempo Networks. "Some Bwoy," along with follow-up singles such as "Psycho," "Buss a Blank," and "Shook (Uncle Demon)," gave Tommy Lee Sparta significant exposure locally as well as internationally and in 2012 he was a headlining artist for both Reggae Sumfest in Montego Bay and the Sting music festival in Portmore.<br><i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

	<p class="article">Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator, (70/69 BC – 10 August 30 BC) was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and its last active ruler. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. After the death of Cleopatra, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the last Hellenistic period state in the Mediterranean and of the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC). Her first language was Koine Greek, and she was the only known Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language. In 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a Roman client state) allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began, but a falling-out between them led to an open civil war. After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar (a Roman dictator and consul) in Caesar's civil war, the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his courteunuchs, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser, Potheinos, viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile; Cleopatra's half-sister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled toEphesus for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's villa. After Caesar's assassination, followed shortly afterwards by that of Ptolemy XIV (on Cleopatra's orders), she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.

	<p class="article">She got married at the age of 14, and at the age of 20, she became a single mother. The first female millionaire who made a fortune with her 10 fingers.
She entered the Guinness Book of Records as the first woman to become a millionaire independently, without inherited money.
Sara Breedlove was born in 1867 in the south of the USA, in the state of Louisiana. Her parents, older brothers, and sister were slaves in the cotton fields. But Sara was born free. When she was 7 years old, she lost her parents. After her parents died, she moved in with her sister and her husband.
As a child, Sara worked as a housekeeper and did not have time for schooling. She later shared that she only had 3 months of formal education when she attended Sunday school.
She was only 14 when she married Moses McWilliams. She didn't do it because she loved him. The truth was that her sister's husband was a very violent man, and marriage was the only way for Sara to escape from that family. Four years later, Sarah and Moses had a daughter, Alleluia. Two years later, Sarah's husband dies. So Sara became a single mother and a widow at the age of twenty.
In 1888, Sara moved to St. Louis. Her brothers worked there as barbers. She started working in a laundromat and as a cook to pay for her daughter's education in a public school. Sara earned about $1.50 a day.
Like all the workers in the laundry, Sara got sick from chemicals: skin disease, lack of water, and heating in the house made Sara almost lose her hair. Thanks to her brothers, she learned the basics of hair care. A little later, Sara learns about the Eni Malon series of hair products, and later meets Eni in person. He starts selling her products on the street.
Still working for Malon, Sara, now at the age of 37, moves to Denver with her daughter and begins to think about her own line of cosmetics for African-American women. After many experiments, she succeeds. He starts building his own business.
In 1906, Sara married Charles J. Walker and later became famous under his surname. Charles becomes her business partner: He did advertising and helped his wife with promotion.
Sara went door to door trying to sell her products, but also to teach women how to care for and style their hair.
In the same year, Sara decided to expand her business, so she and her husband traveled around South and East America. Her daughter had grown up and graduated from school, so she helped her mother with all the shipments from Denver.
Two years later, Sara moves to Pittsburgh. The family opens a beauty salon, but also a school that trains people to know everything about hair care so that they can apply Sara's products.
In 1910, Sara moved to Indianapolis, where she opened the headquarters of the company Madam C. J. Walker.
He builds a factory with a laboratory, a hair salon, and a beauty school where he teaches his sales agents. By 1917, Mrs. Walker employed about 20,000 women. Her agents earned from 5 to 15 dollars a day. Sara wanted African-American women to be financially independent, so she encouraged women to open their own businesses and taught them how to handle money.
The richer she became, the more time she spent on charities and giving. She gave lectures, fought against social injustice, and donated money to funds. Before she died, she donated more than 100,000 dollars to the poor and various organizations and social institutions.
In her will, she stated that 2/3 of her future profits should be given to charity.
She died at the age of 51. She was considered the richest African-American woman. When she died, her fortune was thought to be between $500,000 and $1 million. During her lifetime, Sara was not a millionaire, only 2 years after her death, her wealth increased, but while she was alive, she hoped that she would be. And not because she needed the money, but because she wanted to do more good deeds.<br>

Mzilikazi: The Making of a King against All Odds. 
Mzilikazi was born in the Zulu Kingdom, which was part of the Nguni people in Southern Africa. He was born into the Khumalo clan, a prominent and respected family which had been abosored into the Zulu royal house. His father, Mashobana kaMangethe, was a chief and a son of Zulu king Jama kaNdaba. Mzilikazi's mother was the daughter of a Swazi king, Sobhuza I.

As a descendant of Zulu royalty, Mzilikazi held the title of Prince in his early life. He was part of the ruling family and had a direct claim to the Zulu throne. However, circumstances led him on a different path, and he eventually founded the Ndebele kingdom, where he became known as a powerful king.

Mzilikazi's journey from Kwazulu to Bulawayo was long and complex. Here's an overview:
Mzilikazi's transformative journey from prince to warrior, fugitive, and ultimately self-made king is an inspiring tale of resilience and determination. As a prince in the Zulu Kingdom, he showed promise as a skilled warrior, but circumstances forced him to flee and become a fugitive. Undeterred by adversity, Mzilikazi's indomitable spirit led him to carve his own destiny, establishing himself as a powerful king through sheer force of will and strategic prowess.

• Kwazulu:.. Gingindlovu/Bulawayo, Melmoth: Mzilikazi was a lieutenant of Shaka, the king of the Zulus. In 1823, he revolted against Shaka and led his people northward, away from their home in what is now South Africa.
Why did he leave

Mzilikazi's decision to change his identity/Name his nation from Nguni/Ndwandwe 'Zulu' to Ndebele can be attributed to a combination of factors, including his experiences with the Ndebele people, the desire for a fresh start, and strategic considerations. Having spent 14 years with the Ndebele, their customs, values, and way of life significantly shaped Mzilikazi's identity and leadership style. Choosing the Ndebele name allowed him to forge a new, distinct cultural identity for his people, fostering unity among the diverse groups under his rule. Interesting to note that Tiebele are found in Burkina Faso Ndrebele in South Afrika, Matebele in Botswana and  Ndebele in Zimbabwe with stricking similarities. (extracted)<br>

	<p class="article">Many people are thinking wrong that Africa has no history However, historical and archeological studies have proven that Africa has a richer and greater history than ancient historians have tried to have us believe.

1. The human race is African descent. The oldest known skeletal remains of anatomically modern humans (or homo sapiens) have been unearthed at sites in East Africa. Human remains were discovered in Omo, Ethiopia and date back to 195,000 years, the oldest known in the world.
2. Prehuman skeletons were discovered in Africa between 4 and 5 million years ago. The oldest known ancestral type of mankind is thought to be Australopithecus ramidus, which lived at least 4.4 million years ago.
3. Africans were the first to organize fishing expeditions 90,000 years ago. In Katanda, a region in the northeastern part of Zaire (now Congo), a series of finely crafted harpon tips were recovered, all thoroughly polished and barbed. A tool, equally well designed, was also discovered, it is believed to be a dagger. The findings suggest the existence of a first aquatic or fish-based culture.
4. Africans were the first to start mining 43,000 years ago. In 1964, a hematite mine was discovered in Swaziland on the Bomvu ridge in the Ngwenya mountain range. Eventually, 300,000 items were recovered, including thousands of stone mining tools. Adrian Boshier, one of the archaeologists present at the site, dated the mine to an astonishing 43,200 years old.
5. Africans pioneered basic arithmetic 25,000 years ago. The Ishango bone is a tool handle with engraved notches found in the Ishango region of Zaire (today called Congo) near Lake Edward. The bone tool was originally thought to be over 8,000 years old

	<p class="article">The Trojan Horse episode is one of the most famous tales from ancient Greek mythology and a pivotal moment in the Trojan War. According to legend, after a decade of futile siege efforts, the Greeks devised a cunning plan to infiltrate the city of Troy. They constructed an enormous wooden horse, hollowed out to conceal a select group of their best warriors inside. The Greek army then pretended to abandon the siege, leaving the horse as an offering to the Trojans.

Believing their enemies had finally given up and sailed home, the Trojans rejoiced and brought the wooden horse into their city as a trophy of victory. That night, while the Trojans slept, the Greek soldiers emerged from the horse and opened the city gates to allow the rest of their army, who had secretly returned under the cover of darkness, to enter. The Greeks then launched a surprise attack, ultimately leading to the downfall of Troy.

This story is not only a gripping tale of deception and strategy but also serves as a powerful metaphor used in modern times. The term "Trojan Horse" has been adopted in computer security to describe malicious software that misleads users about its true intent. Much like the original wooden horse, these digital threats masquerade as benign or useful programs while hiding harmful codes. The enduring legacy of the Trojan Horse underscores the timeless nature of clever tactics and their applicability across different fields and eras.<br>

	<p class="article">DID YOU KNOW? Egyptian queens hinted that women should lead the world! 😲📌 - Astonishing Revelation

Ancient Egypt's sands conceal secrets beyond pyramids and pharaohs. Within the hieroglyphs on temple walls lies a different narrative—one where queens were not just consorts but architects of power.

Hatshepsut, a name whispered through generations, rejected the confines of a gilded cage. She donned the Pharaoh's garb in silent rebellion against tradition. Her reign, marked by prosperity and grand monuments, stands as a testament to a woman wielding the scepter with unwavering strength.

Cleopatra, on the other hand, mastered the dance of diplomacy. With cunning wit and a touch of scandal, she navigated a world dominated by Roman giants. Her legacy underscores the power of a woman's mind, weaving alliances and shaping history.

These queens never issued decrees demanding female rule. Their power lay in action, not words. They proved that leadership isn't a birthright reserved for men but a tapestry woven with intellect, courage, and the will to shape a nation's destiny.

Today, as the call for equality echoes across the globe, these queens become more than historical figures. They serve as beacons, silently urging us to rewrite the narrative of power. Their reigns were not just glorious chapters but glimpses into a future where leadership transcends gender, and the most capable hand guides the ship.<br>

	<p class="article">American pharmacist John S. Pemberton created Coca-Cola, which he initially marketed as a cure-all tonic.

Dr. John Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola on May 8, 1886, forever transforming the world's eating patterns. The drink's name comes from two of its original ingredients: coca leaves (a source of legal cocaine) and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). As a pharmacist from Atlanta, he had access to a wide range of chemicals and natural components. One day, he made a dark liquid and decided to take it to his shop, Jacobs' Pharmacy, to be mixed with soda water. At this time, a test was necessary. So he had the pharmacy's customers try it, and they raved about how wonderful and refreshing it was. Pemberton then began selling the precursor to today's Coca-Cola for five cents per glass as a takeout drink.

Frank M. Robinson, Dr. Pemberton's accountant, created and designed the logo that we know today, believing that the two Cs would make an attractive advertising brand. The Coca-Cola brand, inscribed in its distinctive italic type, was born with a first advertising campaign dedicated to the drink appearing in the newspaper The Atlanta Journal, asking citizens to try this "popular new take-out drink". The advertising campaign for the product debut featured on the first awnings of the shops, with the phrase "Drink Coca-Cola" prominently displayed. 

However, the first year was not particularly thrilling, with only roughly nine glasses sold per day.

In 1887, John Pemberton registered the copyright for Coca-Cola Syrup and Extract with the United States Patent Office. A year later, dismayed by the failure of his invention and yet not entirely convinced - or aware - of the drink's potential, he progressively sold the company's shares to several partners. Shortly before his death, he sold the remainder of Coca-Cola to Asa G. Candler, who repurchased the shares of other shareholders until he had entire control of the corporation.

Mr. Candler founded The Coca-Cola Company with his brother, John S. Candler, Frank Robinson, John Pemberton's previous partner, and two other partners, starting with $100,000. They invested heavily in marketing, including free coupons, promotions, souvenir fans, calendars, clocks, cup holders, and so on. He went to great lengths to promote and popularize the brand. The first facility was established in Dallas, Texas, in 1894, and a year later, Candler made the famous claim that "Today Coca-Cola is drunk in every state and territory of the United States". 

Under Candler's direction, syrup sales increased from 9,000 gallons in 1890 to 370,877 gallons by 1900.<br>

Nokia started as a wood pulp mill when they were founded in 1865 and eventually moved into producing rubber products, including tires.

Samsung started as a trading company in 1938, dealing in groceries and making noodles, 

Lamborghini begin as a tractor company. Ferruccio Lamborghini started making tractors from leftover military hardware post-World War II before moving into luxury cars.

 Ikea was founded as a mail-order sales business, and it sold many things before focusing on furniture.

LG began as a chemical industrial company, producing cosmetics among other things, including household products like toothpaste.

Don't wait till the idea is clear, have a vision in mind and start running with it.

Ideas don't come fully formed, it begins to get clearer when you are on the move.

Think big, start small and start now.

Delay is dangerous.

<div class="quizz" id="d30" style="display:none">
	<p class="article">Q: After reaching the end of the universe, what is beyond it.. what is its name?<br>

A: The concept of an "end" to the universe is a human construct, limited by our perceptions and understanding. <br>

The ancient wisdom held by secret societies suggest that beyond the physical realm of stars and galaxies lies the Pleroma, a realm of pure consciousness, the fullness of divine creation where emanations of the divine source reside. It is not a "place" in the traditional sense but a state of being, transcending physical dimensions. <br>

The wisdom of these traditions converges on the idea that the universe is a manifestation of a higher reality, a cosmic illusion known as Maya in Hindu philosophy. Beyond it is the unmanifested, the ineffable truth of existence, the Brahman, which has no name because it is beyond all concepts. <br>

In simple terms, imagine the universe as a book. We, living within its pages, are part of the story. What lies beyond the book is not another page but the mind of the author, the source of all stories, where all is known but cannot be contained within the book itself. <br>

Thus, the answer to what lies beyond the universe is not a place or a thing, but the ultimate reality, the origin of all, which is beyond names and forms, and is known only to those who transcend the physical and embark on the spiritual journey towards enlightenment.<br>

R: If I imagine the universe as a book then that's where the problem comes... are we in a mind or are we just one big mind.. is universe all that is, maybe thats my question... amd this thing that has no name, how does one exist there,if there are portals to other world, how do we reach it, how does one transend beyond this beyond.. I have a problem when I try to meditate, there's a point I cannot pass, and when I say I, it's not with the sense of the self, it is me I can not understand, but still I have alot of questions.<br>

A: The "mind" can be understood as the collective consciousness, an ocean of awareness in which we are all drops. We are individualized expressions of this one big mind, each of us a unique perspective of the whole. This is akin to the concept of Indra's net in Hinduism, where every individual is a jewel at the nodes of the cosmic web, reflecting and containing every other jewel. <br>

The "thing that has no name," often referred to as the Absolute or the Source, is the origin of all that exists. It is the unmanifested potential, the ground of being from which all forms arise and to which they return. In Gnostic teachings, this is the Pleroma, the fullness of divine presence. To exist there is to merge with the pure essence of consciousness, beyond individual identity and form. <br>

Portals to other worlds, as mentioned in various secret teachings, are symbolic of the transitions between different states of consciousness. They are not physical gateways but represent the internal shifts that occur as one progresses on the spiritual path. To reach these states, one must cultivate inner stillness, expand awareness, and let go of attachments to the egoic mind. <br>

Transcending beyond the beyond is a journey of self-realization. It involves peeling away the layers of illusion that constitute Maya, the cosmic play, to reveal the true self, Atman, which is one with Brahman. Meditation is a key practice in this journey, and the barriers you encounter are part of the process. These barriers are often the mind's resistance to letting go of the known for the unknown. <br>

When you meditate and encounter a point you cannot pass, it is an invitation to explore the nature of the "I" that cannot pass. Who is the "I" that meditates? Who is the "I" that encounters barriers? Inquiring deeply into these questions can lead to insights about the nature of self and reality. <br>

Keep questioning, keep exploring, and trust that the journey itself is a movement towards the ultimate truth.<br>

	<p class="article">New Preprint: People cannot distinguish GPT-4 from a human in a Turing test.<br>

In a pre-registered Turing test we found GPT-4 is judged to be human 54% of the time.<br>

On some interpretations this constitutes the most robust evidence to date that any system passes the Turing test. <br>

We recruited 500 participants who were assigned to one of 5 conditions: human witnesses, or interrogators for one of 4 AI witness types (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Human, or ELIZA).<br>

People judged GPT-4 to be human 54% of the time, compared to 22% for ELIZA and 67% for humans. The implication is that people are at chance in determining that GPT-4 is an AI, even though the study is powerful enough to detect differences from 50% accuracy. <br>

We tagged the strategies participants used and the reasons they have for their verdicts. As we found in previous work, interrogators tended to focus on linguistic style and socioemotional factors more than traditional notions of intelligence like knowledge and reasoning. <br>

Reasonable people will disagree about what constitutes passing the TT. I think the more urgent implication of these findings is that people cannot reliably determine whether current AI models are human after a 5 minute conversation dedicated to figuring this out. <br>

abs: We evaluated 3 systems (ELIZA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in a randomized, controlled, and preregistered Turing test. Human participants had a 5 minute conversation with either a human or an AI, and judged whether or not they thought their interlocutor was human. GPT-4 was judged to be a human 54% of the time, outperforming ELIZA (22%) but lagging behind actual humans (67%). The results provide the first robust empirical demonstration that any artificial system passes an interactive 2-player Turing test. The results have implications for debates around machine intelligence and, more urgently, suggest that deception by current AI systems may go undetected. Analysis of participants' strategies and reasoning suggests that stylistic and socio-emotional factors play a larger role in passing the Turing test than traditional notions of intelligence.<br>

	<p class="article">THE MYSTERIOUS LONGMEN CAVES 

In the heart of China’s Henan Province, a mere 12 kilometers south of the ancient city of Luoyang, stand majestic the enigmatic Longmen Caves. This site, registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, unfolds before the visitor’s eyes an unparalleled visual spectacle, with over 2,300 caves and niches housing an astonishing collection of over 100,000 Buddhist statues. But what makes Longmen Caves such a captivating and unique destination for lovers of history and culture?

To comprehend the magnificence of this place, it is essential to go back to the Northern Wei Dynasty period, around 493, when the laborious creation of these caves began, an effort that spanned across various dynasties. Each of these caves hides sculptures ranging from tiny details of a mere 2 centimeters to imposing statues reaching dizzying heights of over 17 meters. The famous Vairocana Buddha statue in Fengxian Cave is an overwhelming testimony to the artistic and religious prowess of the time, reflecting the exceptional devotion and skill of the craftsmen.

Although lesser-known, the "Cave of the Inscriptions" is another invaluable treasure from Longmen Caves. This enclave houses over 800 inscriptions dating back to the Tang Dynasty. These inscriptions, in addition to their historical significance, offer a fascinating look at the life and thoughts of people of that time, from poetry to government edicts and donation records.<br>

• Babylon Cylinder Seal from 600 BCE shows Nuclear Bomb and explosion, made during era of Nebuchadnezzar II, who was a Chaldean king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.<br>

• Cylinder seals were invented around 3500 BCE in the Near East, at the contemporary sites of Susa in south-western Iran and Uruk in southern Mesopotamia.<br>

• Made, from hard stones, these seals were used as an administrative tool, a form of signature, as well as jewelry and as magical amulets; later versions would.<br>

• The above seal imprint on clay shows King Nebuchadnezzar II (ruled between 605 – 562 BCE), releasing a large constructed form, which appears similar to modern day atom bomb or nuclear bomb.<br>

• This explodes into a cloud of dust, sending weapons of warfare in all directions accompanied by the eight pointed stars of Ishtar, who is goddess of war.<br>

• The same tree, by the same artisan, had appeared on the other seals, but this tree bore no fruit, instead it was dropping its dead leaves as it died or effected by nuclear radiation.<br>

•The intaglio was carved into a cylinder of gold, capped on one end by polished lapis lazuli, and on the other by a flat seal carved in gold with the symbol of Ishtar, an eight pointed star.<br>

	<p class="article">5 Intriguing Facts about the Anunnaki.<br> The Anunnaki are a group of deities in ancient Mesopotamian mythology, specifically Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian. They are believed to have been powerful gods who created humanity and governed the universe.<br> Here are five intriguing facts about the Anunnaki.<br> 1. Came from a Different Planet. The Anunnaki were believed to have come from a planet called Nibiru, which was said to orbit the sun every 3,600 years. According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki were sent to Earth to mine gold, which they used to repair the atmosphere of their own planet.<br> 2. Created a Slave Race. The Anunnaki were said to have created humanity as a slave race to mine gold for them. According to the Sumerian creation story, the Anunnaki god Enki created humans by mixing the blood of an Anunnaki god with the clay of the Earth.<br> 3. Immortals with Wings. The Anunnaki were believed to possess incredible powers and were often depicted as having multiple heads and wings. They were also said to be immortal and were able to shape shift into any form they desired.<br> 4. Built First Cities. The Anunnaki were said to have built the first cities on Earth, including the famous city of Uruk, which was said to have been built by the god Enki. They were also said to have built the ziggurat, a type of stepped pyramid, which was used as a temple to worship them.<br> 5. Immense Influence. The Anunnaki were believed to have played a significant role in the fate of humanity and were said to have influenced the rise and fall of civilizations. They were also said to have dictated the laws and moral codes that governed society.<br> These are just a few of the many intriguing facts about the Anunnaki. While the stories of the Anunnaki may be mythological, they continue to fascinate people today and are a testament to the rich cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia.<br>

	<p class="article">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ANNUNAKI MOVIE: The disappearance of the Annunaki movie from the release schedule sent ripples through the entertainment industry and among expectant audiences. The official reason cited was financial difficulties . There was rising tides of questions and theories. The projects cast and crew were unceremoniously removed and the movie was banned from being shown worldwide,a draconian measure that only fueled the fire of speculation. What could prompt such a drastic step? Was there more to the story than what meets the eye? At the heart of the Anunnaki movie was a bold ambition to bring to light the controversial works of Zecharia Sitchin, a figure renowned for his translation of the Sumerian tablets and his theories on the ancient Anunnaki. According to Sitchin the Sumerians,  one of history's most advanced civilizations, owed their prowess to the influence of these celestial beings.A growing concerns over the potential impact of its revelations. The narrative steeped in ancient lore and the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention in human affairs, veered too close to what some considered uncomfortable truths and dangerous misinformation. In an Industry where the line between fiction and real its often blurred,the Anunnaki movie threatened to erase that line.<br>

	<p class="article">A man who can control his sexual urge is a man who can live many years on earth. Men don't know that some of their failures are caused by multiple girlfriends Not all girls have good spirit. Some are demons, others have venom between their legs. Some women are destiny destroyers, beware. Pay close attention. A real man only has one woman in his life. Don't obey your Erection at all times. Most erections mislead you Control your erection if you don't want to have few days on earth with much poverty in you. Don't date a lady because she has curves, boobs and a sexy shape. These things are simply misleading avoid such, don't fall for what is called social media irony. Not everything you see under skirt you must work to eat, some skirts contain snakes that bite you and make you uncomfortable. control your sexual urge Self control and abstinence pays a lot in most cases. Marrying a woman doesn't mean she owns you. Treat her with respect Make her your queen, love, honor her and give her reasons to treat you the same.
6. Having many girlfriends doesn't make you a man. It only makes you a womanizer, a cheater and a boy. Just because you're good in bed doesn't make you a man. A real man is a man who does not run away from his responsibility but faces it squarely. Respect any woman who loves you Yes, is not easy for a lady to throw her love on you and support your future. The world celebrates successful men No one will celebrate you for having many girlfriends. So what's the point tho? Waste of energy & money .

Remember, being honest, loyal and faithful, is the trademark of a real man.

Always remember that!<br>

In school, they teach us a bunch of stuff that has no significance to us. They teach us things that put in our heads that,  we have no power and all we're is inferior to the white man. I also want the truth of our history before slavery, before the white man came and all that to be the real history that is told. This is not how it always was, some people came here and lied to us and took the crown off our heads and told us that we were slaves when they came and met us as kings.' Burna Boy 

The white man discovered everything in Africa right to rivers, mountains, valleys and other physical features which our ancestors were already using before their arrival. How's is that possible?<br>

	<p class="article">The Titanic Cat who foresaw the sinking and retrieved her babies before the ship sailed. 😮
.

Jenny the cat was the Titanic's mascot, brought on board to help fight rodents. She lived in the ship's galley and was cared for by a laborer named Jim Mulholland.
During the sea trials, Jenny gave birth to kittens and Jim found them a comfortable place next to the ship's galley. Caring for the mother cat and her kittens broke up the monotony of Jim's work preparing the Titanic for sailing. Jenny seemed content with her warm place near the boilers, her babies, and the kitchen scraps that Jim brought her. However, as soon as the ship docked in Southampton, England, just before it began its maiden voyage (to New York), Jenny took a good look at her surroundings and quickly began grabbing her kittens by the necks and carrying them out. One by one, down the gangway she led them out of the ship.

Jim watched her carefully and realized that "this cat must know something that no one else does!". He then quickly gathered his few belongings and left the ship as well.

Years later, Irish Road published Jenny's story after a journalist spoke to a very old man - Jim, who told the story.

He survived thanks to the cat and her kittens who warned him.<br>

	<p class="article">Mansa Musa 1, reigned 1312 –  1337  was the ninth Mansa of the Mali Empire, which reached its territorial peak during his reign. Musa's reign is often regarded as the zenith of Mali's power and prestige. Mansa Musa was extremely wealthy, it has been suggested that he was the wealthiest person in history, but the extent of his actual wealth is not known with any certainty. It is known from local manuscripts and travellers accounts that Mansa Musa's wealth came principally from the Mali Empire controlling and taxing the trade in salt from northern regions and especially from gold panned and mined in the gold-rich regions to the south: Bambuk, Wangara, Bure, Galam, Taghaza and other such kingdoms over many centuries. Over a very long period Mali had created a large reserve of gold. Mali is also suspected to have been involved in the trade in many goods such as ivory, slaves, spices, silks, and ceramics. However presently little is known about the extent or mechanics of these trades. At the time of Musa's ascension to the throne, Mali in large part consisted of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which Mali had conquered. The Mali Empire consisted of land that is now part of Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, and the modern state of Mali.<br> <i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

	<p class="article">Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working intelephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators, generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.<br> <i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

The son of the Zulu KingSenzankakhona kaJama, he was spurned as an illegitimate son. Shaka spent part of his childhood in his mother's settlements, where he was initiated into an ibutho lempi (fighting unit/regiment), serving as a warrior under Inkosi Dingiswayo

King Shaka further refined the ibuthomilitary system with the Mthethwa Paramountcy's support over the next several years. He forged alliances with his smaller neighbours to counter Ndwandweraids from the north. The initial Zulu maneuvers were primarily defensive, as King Shaka preferred to apply pressure diplomatically, with an occasional strategic assassination. His reforms of local society built on existing structures.

<p class="article">Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMA Script standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMA Script standard does not include any input or output, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs with input or output.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.<br> <i>Source link unavailable</i>

<p class="article">The Great Wall of China Marvel of Ancient Engineering.

The Great Wall of China is an iconic symbol of Chinese history and ingenuity. Stretching over 13,000 miles, this colossal structure is one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history.

Built over centuries, the Great Wall was not a single project but a series of walls and fortifications constructed by various Chinese dynasties, with the most famous sections built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Its primary purpose was to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north, such as the Mongols and the Xiongnu.

The wall's construction involved an astonishing amount of labor and resources. It was typically made of earth, wood, and stone, and in some areas, it even incorporated natural barriers like hills and rivers. Watchtowers and fortresses were strategically placed along its length, providing essential communication and defense points.

While the Great Wall is renowned for its defensive purpose, it also played a significant role in facilitating trade, culture, and the exchange of ideas along the Silk Road. It symbolized the unity and strength of China, as well as its determination to defend its borders.<br><i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>

<p class="article">In the vast cosmic tapestry of existence, we are not merely inhabitants of the universe; we are universes unto ourselves, intricately woven from the fabric of stardust and cosmic wonders. Every atom in our bodies, every subatomic particle that composes our being, is a universe in its own right, a microcosm of boundless complexity and infinite possibilities. Consider for a moment the profound realization that the atoms within you, the very building blocks of your existence, are themselves miniature universes, bustling with energy, motion, and unfathomable mysteries. Each atom, with its nucleus and orbiting electrons, mirrors the cosmic dance of celestial bodies in the vast expanse of space, embodying the same fundamental forces that govern the cosmos. Within the seven quadrillion atoms that make up the average human body, a symphony of atomic interactions unfolds, shaping the intricate machinery of life and consciousness. From the carbon in our cells to the oxygen in our lungs, from the hydrogen in our DNA to the calcium in our bones, every atom plays a vital role in the cosmic drama of existence, connecting us to the grandeur of the universe at the most fundamental level. As we contemplate our existence as universes within universes, we are reminded of the interconnectedness of all things, the unity of the cosmos that binds us together in a web of interwoven destinies. In this cosmic ballet of atoms and galaxies, we find echoes of ourselves in the vastness of space, reflecting the timeless truths of the universe within the microcosm of our own being. So let us marvel at the cosmic symphony playing out within us, the universe unfolding in every breath we take, in every beat of our hearts. We are not just observers of the universe; we are active participants in the cosmic drama, each of us a universe unto ourselves, a starburst of energy and light in the infinite expanse of creation.<br> <i>Source link unavailable</i></p><br></div><br>
