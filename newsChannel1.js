Their society is renowned for its intricate social structures and the formidable skill of its warriors. By the early 19th century, the Zulu had begun to consolidate power under the leadership of Shaka Zulu, a visionary and strategic leader. Shaka Zulu, born around 17 87, transformed the Zulu kingdom through innovative military tactics and social reforms. He introduced new weapons, such as the short stabbing spear assegai, and implemented rigorous training programs for his warriors. Shaka's strategies emphasized discipline, speed, and efficiency, enabling the Zulu to outmaneuver and overpower rival tribes. His leadership and reforms unified the Zulu people, turning them into a dominant force in southern Africa. Under Shaka's reign, the Zulu kingdom expanded significantly, incorporating numerous neighboring tribes and territories. This period, known as the Mfecane or crushing, was marked by widespread upheaval and migration as the Zulu empire grew. Shaka's influence extended beyond military conquest he also restructured the Zulu social system, enhancing the cohesion and stability of his kingdom.");

The methods he used predicted theories of integration that developed 1800 years later. He was also a pioneer in the science of hydrostatic, the study of pressure and fluid balance.

The Electrobat, powered by a lead-acid battery, could travel up to 25 miles on a single charge and reach speeds of 15 miles per hour.

Hit 'Em Up had a large role in exacerbating the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. Following its release, the East Coast rappers insulted in the song responded through tracks of their own.

  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Once upon a time, in the vast cosmos, numerous extraterrestrial species made contact with our planet. Many governments worldwide have kept highly classified records documenting these encounters, detailing the physical attributes, planetary origins, and histories of these beings. To many other extraterrestrial species, humans are considered the 'new kids on the block,' and Earth is seen as an abandoned seed colony. Spiritual mediums on Earth have the ability to communicate with higher astral extraterrestrial beings, often described as peaceful and angelic. In contrast, malevolent lower astral beings, often called demons, manifest in both physical and spiritual forms within evil dimensional frequencies. Like humanity, extraterrestrial beings range from good to evil, a duality that is important to understand as we explore our cosmic kin. Among the many known extraterrestrial species, the Arcturians stand out. Inhabiting the 11th dimension, they are ancient, wise, and angelic, believed to be the first species given the gift of life in our galaxy. They are about 5-6 feet tall, with beautiful blue skin and large, perceptive eyes. Their advanced technology and peaceful nature make them ideal members of the Galactic Federation of Worlds. The Grays, originating from the Zeti Reticuli star system, are another well-known species. They are often perceived as malevolent due to their abductions of humans for genetic material, aimed at creating hybrids to save their race. The Annunaki, or Sirians from the Sirius B star system, are believed to have engineered our ancestors and are depicted in ancient Mesopotamian and Sumerian civilizations. They are technologically advanced but still spiritually evolving, living for thousands of years. The Draconian Reptilians, from the Draco star system, are considered the most malevolent. They are ancient, powerful, and feed off low frequencies, fear, and death, making them a significant threat to other species. The Pleiadians, resembling blonde Vikings, are peaceful and spiritually advanced, often associated with energy manipulation, healing, and interstellar travel. They are believed to have seeded life on Earth along with the Arcturians and Lyrans. The Sassani are human-gray hybrids living in the 5th dimension, known for their peaceful nature and advanced spirituality. They were created to overcome the reproductive issues faced by the Grays. Lyrans, originating from the Lyra constellation, are a diverse group with different physical appearances and are involved in the ongoing cosmic struggle against the Draconians. Lastly, the Carians, the first beings incarnated in the universe, developed bodies resembling birds and created the Draconian Reptilians. They are intellectual and courteous, focusing on science, exploration, and philosophy. Throughout history, a cosmic conflict has raged between benevolent and malevolent forces, reflecting the struggle between good and evil. Our mission is to overcome darkness and return to the light, promoting knowledge, unity, and enlightenment among humanity.");

The true origins of these divine rulers lay with the Anunnaki, who integrated themselves into Egyptian society, guiding the civilization's growth and prosperity. Ra, the sun god, was actually Ra'kesh, an Anunnaki scientist who harnessed solar energy to power the pyramids and other monumental structures. Isis and Osiris were also Anunnaki, revered for their medical knowledge and ability to extend life. They established a dynasty of pharaohs, each infused with Anunnaki knowledge and technology. The most significant artifact left by the Anunnaki was the Eye of Horus, a device capable of granting visions of the future and healing the sick. This device was hidden within the Great Pyramid, protected by traps and riddles only a true descendant of the Anunnaki could solve. In modern times, Egyptologist Dr. Nefertari Saad discovers a hidden passage in the Great Pyramid. Her findings lead her to the Eye of Horus, awakening it after millennia of dormancy. The device projects a message from Ra'kesh, revealing the true history of the Anunnaki pharaohs and their intentions for humanity. Dr. Saad, with the help of geneticist Dr. Amir Khalid, uncovers that she is a direct descendant of the Anunnaki, capable of unlocking the full potential of the Eye of Horus.

  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("In the ancient texts of Genesis, a mysterious tale unfolds where the 'sons of God' descended to Earth and mingled with the 'daughters of men.' This union produced a hybrid race known as the Nephilim, or 'fallen ones,' who were described as giants, mighty beings towering between 8 and 15 feet tall. This narrative isn't confined to the Bible; it echoes through Sumerian legends, where gods consorted with humans, resulting in giant offspring. Mythology across cultures is replete with stories of giants. To modern eyes, these tales can be reinterpreted. Imagine replacing the word 'angel' with 'extraterrestrial.' At the dawn of time, extraterrestrials might have interbred with humans, giving rise to these colossal beings. As geneticists continue to decode the human genome, could they uncover evidence of these ancient giants? Could our DNA hold traces of a missing link to these enormous beings from another world? Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that our ancestors' texts, such as early Judaic writings, offer profound insights. For instance, Kabbalistic traditions describe the first man, Adam, not as a regular human but as a giant. This ancient race, the Adamic race, might have been of a greater stature than we are today. Is this merely symbolic, or does it hint at a literal truth? Was Adam a giant, and are we, his descendants, from a race of giants? Mainstream science, grounded in Darwinistic views, often challenges these notions. Yet, mythology and ancient texts persistently speak of giants. Archaeological findings, like enormous bones, occasionally surface, only to be disputed. Despite skepticism, the possibility remains that giants did exist, born from the union of extraterrestrials and humans. Megalithic structures, shared religious traditions, and sporadic discoveries of large human remains may be the remnants of a lost civilization of giants. These beings could have played a significant role in the creation of humankind. Perhaps one day, conclusive evidence will emerge, revealing that within the mythological tales of our ancestors lies the true history of the human race.");

His father, Senzangakhona, was a minor chief of one of the Zulu-speaking clans and his mother, Nandi, was daughter of Chief Mbhengi of the rival clan.  Shaka’s birth was considered a sin because his parents were from different clans. Due to pressure from tribal leaders Shaka’s parents separated resulting in the exile of him and his mother from his father’s clan. Shaka’s mother returned to her Elangeni where she was shunned.  Consequently, her son Shaka was harassed, tormented, and neglected. As Shaka grew older, he recalled with anger his tormenting by Elangeni members.  Upon reaching manhood he deserted the Elangeni and became affiliated with the Mthethwa clan. He served as a warrior for six years under the reign of Dingiswayo, the Mthethwa’s chief. Dingiswayo was impressed by Shaka’s courage and endurance.  Shaka remained with the Mthethwa until he learned of the death of his father, Senzangakhona, in 18 16. Shaka claimed his father’s chieftaincy with military assistance from Dingiswayo.  With his experience learned from the Mthethwa, he transformed his clan’s military from a largely ceremonial force into a powerful army capable of both defense and aggression. In 18 18, Shaka’s mentor Dingiswayo was assassinated by Zwide, the chief of the Ndwandwe clan.  Shaka sought revenge and received it in 18 20 with the Zulu’s victory over the Ndwandwe in the Battle of Mhlatuze River. Shaka then set out to forge the various Zulu-speaking clans into a powerful empire. As he incorporated rival groups, the Zulu Empire’s population reached an estimated 250,000 and his state emerged as the largest in the history of Southern Africa. In 18 27, at the height of his power, Shaka could order into the field of battle over 50,000 warriors and controlled most of the area that is now the modern state of South Africa. Shaka’s actions became simultaneously more tyrannical, ruthless and bizarre as power concentrated in his hands. In 18 27 at the height of his power, his mother, Nandi, died.  Anger over her death and over her (and his) treatment at the hands of the Elangeni led him to order the massacre of thousands of tribal members.  His brutal treatment of his own Army nearly led to its mutiny. In 18 28, Shaka was assassinated by his half brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana.  Dingane assumed control of the Empire which lasted another half century before finally being crushed by the British Army.");

  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("John Carter is a 2012 American science fiction action-adventure film directed by Andrew Stanton, written by Stanton, Mark Andrews, and Michael Chabon, and based on A Princess of Mars, the first book in the Barsoom series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Produced by Jim Morris, Colin Wilson and Lindsey Collins, it stars Taylor Kitsch in the title role, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds, Dominic West, James Purefoy and Willem Dafoe. It chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of John Carter and his attempts to mediate civil unrest amongst the warring kingdoms of Barsoom. Several attempts to adapt the Barsoom series had been made since the 19 30s by various major studios and producers. Most of these efforts ultimately stalled in development hell. In the late-2000s, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort to adapt Burroughs' works to film, after an abandoned venture in the 19 80s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the screen rights from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became the new film's director in 2009. It was his live-action debut, after his directorial work for Disney on the Pixar animated films Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Filming began in November 2009, with principal photography underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July. Michael Giacchino, who scored many Pixar films, composed the music. Like Pixar's Brave that same year, the film is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. It was released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on March 9, 2012, marking the centennial of the titular character's first appearance. It was presented in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visuals, Giacchino's score, and the action sequences, but criticism of the characterization and plot. It failed at the North American box office, but set an opening-day record in Russia. It grossed $284 million at the worldwide box office, resulting in a $200 million writedown for Disney, becoming one of the biggest box office bombs in history. With a total cost of $350 million, including an estimated production budget of $263 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Due to its poor performance, Disney cancelled plans for Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, the rest of the trilogy Stanton had planned. John Carter's failure has been blamed on its promotion, which has been called 'one of the worst marketing campaigns in movie history'. Critics focus on the decision to remove the words 'Princess' and 'Mars' from the title out of fear of alienating young men and women, leaving prospective audiences to try to deduce what the film was about from trailers and ads that were similarly uninformative about its characters and plot, its place in the development of science fiction, and who had made it. The images they showed also seemed derivative of works such as Star Wars, Dune and Avatar that were themselves informed by the Barsoom stories. Other critics have argued the film was doomed from the start since those works had so thoroughly appropriated the source material as to ensure that modern audiences would see John Carter as unoriginal.");

He waged one of the most effective resistance efforts to colonialism (from the Dutch Boer settlers and British Empire) over many decades, as well as to Shaka’s military consolidation of what became Zulu Kingdom in the 18 20s. His name was originally a nickname derived from a poem he wrote as a youth, a braggadocio-filled anthem to farm animal theft that could put most hip-hop moguls to shame. From the poorly sourced Wikipedia version of the story: During his youth, he was very brave and once organised a cattle raid against Ramonaheng and captured several herds. As was the tradition, he composed a poem praising himself where, amongst the words he used to refer to himself, said he was “like a razor which has shaved all Ramonaheng’s beards”, referring to his successful raid. In Sesotho language, a razor makes a “shoe…shoe…” sound, and after that he was affectionately called Moshoeshoe: 'the shaver'. 1 He founded his own all-new clan at age 34. Presumably on the strength of his charisma, diplomatic flair, and cattle-rustling skills. This clan established a settlement in a location that could withstand Zulu assaults. His original clan eventually grew to be Lesotho and environs. 2 He never lost a major battle!He ruled for 48 years against a colonial onslaught. Many native rulers in Africa were unable to maintain such a strong level of sovereignty and control in their domains during the period. 3 He united the various Sotho people into a Basotho nation through a combination of battle followed by compassionate diplomacy (rather than subjugation through conquest). 4 He was very willing to mess with the Boers as they tried to invade. 5 He would give them fair conditions for maintaining peaceful coexistence and then beat them back when they rebelled");

This change was in response to evolving warfare, which required faster movement that armor hindered. They would have been bare-chested, wearing a Corinthian-style helmet, cloak, leg greaves, sword, spear, and shield, while still proudly sporting their long flowing hair as part of their military legacy.

Construction began around 800 AD and continued until 1460 AD, involving large-scale manual labour and the repurposing of earth from the inner ditch to build the outer berm.

Gibson emphasizes the culture’s complexity and brutality, depicting both the splendor of its cities and the savagery of its rituals. 'Apocalypto' is renowned for its visceral action sequences and breathtaking cinematography, capturing the lush, perilous jungle environment. The narrative is a relentless survival tale, emphasizing themes of resilience, family, and the struggle against oppression. Despite its critical and box office success, 'Apocalypto' sparked controversy for its depiction of Mayan culture, with some critics arguing it sensationalizes violence and distorts historical facts. Nevertheless, it remains a gripping, visually stunning film that offers a raw, intense glimpse into a pivotal historical moment.");

In Egypt, dreadlocks were worn by the priests of the god Ptah, and they were also worn by members of the Rastafarian religion in Jamaica. Dreadlocks became a popular hairstyle among the Rastafarians in the 1930s. The Rastafarian movement was founded in Jamaica and is based on a combination of Christian and African spiritual beliefs. The Rastafarians believe that the hair is a symbol of the strength and vitality of their African heritage, and they wear dreadlocks as a way to express this belief. In addition to its religious significance, dreadlocks have also become a symbol of rebellion and counterculture. During the 1960s and 1970s, dreadlocks were popular among hippies and other groups who rejected mainstream society. Throughout different cultures, people have worn locs for various reasons. For instance, the Maasai warriors of Africa have been known to wear long, thin, red dreadlocks which they dye with red root extracts or red ochre. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, there are children born with naturally locked hair who are referred to as 'Dada' by the Yoruba in Nigeria. The Rastafari movement sees dreadlocks as a symbol of the Lion of Judah, which is sometimes featured on the Ethiopian flag. The followers of the Rastafari believe that Haile Selassie is directly related to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through their son Menelik I. They were inspired to wear dreadlocks by the Nazarites mentioned in the Bible. Today, dreadlocks are worn by people of all races and backgrounds, and they have become a popular hairstyle in many parts of the world. While they still hold religious and cultural significance for some, many people simply wear them as a personal expression of style. Despite their growing popularity, dreadlocks have also been the subject of controversy and discrimination. In some workplaces and schools, they have been banned, and some people have faced discrimination because of their hairstyle. Overall, the history of dreadlocks is a complex and multifaceted one, with deep roots in ancient civilizations and a continuing significance in modern culture.");

One of the central enigmas surrounding the Anunnaki revolves around their purported advanced knowledge and technology. From the construction of monumental structures like the ziggurats to their alleged genetic manipulation of humans, the Anunnaki are often depicted as possessing capabilities far beyond those of ancient civilizations. In modern times, the concept of the Anunnaki has become intertwined with fringe theories such as ancient astronaut theory and conspiracy narratives.

He has been a controversial figure in dancehall due to his self-described Gothic Dancehall style, which often features dark and Satanist-inspired subject matter. Tommy Lee Sparta began deejaying in late 2007 at Snipa Studios in Flankers, where he recorded his first song, Spartan Story. During this time, he performed as an opening act for local shows, including several from Portmore artist Vybz Kartel. Kartel, noticing that the artist was receiving positive responses from the crowd, invited him to move to Kingston and become a part of the Portmore Empire, Kartel's music crew. Tommy Lee Sparta, however, was reluctant to leave his family and neighborhood, and declined the offer. According to Tommy Lee Sparta, it wasn't until his performance at Vybz Kartel's Birthday Bash on 7 January 2010 that he decided to take the idea of being a musician seriously, and he soon accepted the offer to become an official member of the Portmore Empire crew. Warn Dem, released in November 2010, was Tommy Lee Sparta's first recognized hit, based on a riddim by Da Wiz, his original producer from Snipa Studios.

After theÂ death of Cleopatra, Egypt becameÂ a provinceÂ of theÂ Roman Empire, marking the end of the lastÂ Hellenistic periodÂ state in theÂ MediterraneanÂ and of the age that had lasted since theÂ reign of AlexanderÂ (336â€“323 BC).

Sara Breedlove was born in 1867 in the south of the USA, in the state of Louisiana. Her parents, older brothers, and sister were slaves in the cotton fields. But Sara was born free. When she was 7 years old, she lost her parents. After her parents died, she moved in with her sister and her husband. As a child, Sara worked as a housekeeper and did not have time for schooling. She later shared that she only had 3 months of formal education when she attended Sunday school. She was only 14 when she married Moses McWilliams. She didn't do it because she loved him. The truth was that her sister's husband was a very violent man, and marriage was the only way for Sara to escape from that family. Four years later, Sarah and Moses had a daughter, Alleluia. Two years later, Sarah's husband dies. So Sara became a single mother and a widow at the age of twenty. In 1888, Sara moved to St. Louis. Her brothers worked there as barbers. She started working in a laundromat and as a cook to pay for her daughter's education in a public school. Sara earned about $1.50 a day. Like all the workers in the laundry, Sara got sick from chemicals: skin disease, lack of water, and heating in the house made Sara almost lose her hair. Thanks to her brothers, she learned the basics of hair care. A little later, Sara learns about the Eni Malon series of hair products, and later meets Eni in person. He starts selling her products on the street. Still working for Malon, Sara, now at the age of 37, moves to Denver with her daughter and begins to think about her own line of cosmetics for African-American women. After many experiments, she succeeds. He starts building his own business. In 1906, Sara married Charles J. Walker and later became famous under his surname. Charles becomes her business partner: He did advertising and helped his wife with promotion. Sara went door to door trying to sell her products, but also to teach women how to care for and style their hair. In the same year, Sara decided to expand her business, so she and her husband traveled around South and East America. Her daughter had grown up and graduated from school, so she helped her mother with all the shipments from Denver. Two years later, Sara moves to Pittsburgh. The family opens a beauty salon, but also a school that trains people to know everything about hair care so that they can apply Sara's products. In 1910, Sara moved to Indianapolis, where she opened the headquarters of the company Madam C. J. Walker. He builds a factory with a laboratory, a hair salon, and a beauty school where he teaches his sales agents. By 1917, Mrs. Walker employed about 20,000 women. Her agents earned from 5 to 15 dollars a day. Sara wanted African-American women to be financially independent, so she encouraged women to open their own businesses and taught them how to handle money. The richer she became, the more time she spent on charities and giving. She gave lectures, fought against social injustice, and donated money to funds. Before she died, she donated more than 100,000 dollars to the poor and various organizations and social institutions. In her will, she stated that 2/3 of her future profits should be given to charity. She died at the age of 51. She was considered the richest African-American woman. When she died, her fortune was thought to be between $500,000 and $1 million. During her lifetime, Sara was not a millionaire, only 2 years after her death, her wealth increased, but while she was alive, she hoped that she would be.

He was born into the Khumalo clan, a prominent and respected family which had been abosored into the Zulu royal house. His father, Mashobana kaMangethe, was a chief and a son of Zulu king Jama kaNdaba. Mzilikazi's mother was the daughter of a Swazi king, Sobhuza I. As a descendant of Zulu royalty, Mzilikazi held the title of Prince in his early life. He was part of the ruling family and had a direct claim to the Zulu throne. However, circumstances led him on a different path, and he eventually founded the Ndebele kingdom, where he became known as a powerful king. Mzilikazi's journey from Kwazulu to Bulawayo was long and complex. Here's an overview: Mzilikazi's transformative journey from prince to warrior, fugitive, and ultimately self-made king is an inspiring tale of resilience and determination. As a prince in the Zulu Kingdom, he showed promise as a skilled warrior, but circumstances forced him to flee and become a fugitive. Undeterred by adversity, Mzilikazi's indomitable spirit led him to carve his own destiny, establishing himself as a powerful king through sheer force of will and strategic prowess. Kwazulu:.. Gingindlovu/Bulawayo, Melmoth: Mzilikazi was a lieutenant of Shaka, the king of the Zulus. In 1823, he revolted against Shaka and led his people northward, away from their home in what is now South Africa. Why did he leave. Mzilikazi's decision to change his identity/Name his nation from Nguni/Ndwandwe 'Zulu' to Ndebele can be attributed to a combination of factors, including his experiences with the Ndebele people, the desire for a fresh start, and strategic considerations. Having spent 14 years with the Ndebele, their customs, values, and way of life significantly shaped Mzilikazi's identity and leadership style. Choosing the Ndebele name allowed him to forge a new, distinct cultural identity for his people, fostering unity among the diverse groups under his rule. Interesting to note that Tiebele are found in Burkina Faso Ndrebele in South Afrika, Matebele in Botswana and  Ndebele in Zimbabwe with stricking similarities.");

Human remains were discovered in Omo, Ethiopia and date back to 195,000 years, the oldest known in the world. 2 Prehuman skeletons were discovered in Africa between 4 and 5 million years ago. The oldest known ancestral type of mankind is thought to be Australopithecus ramidus, which lived at least 4.4 million years ago. 3 Africans were the first to organize fishing expeditions 90,000 years ago. In Katanda, a region in the northeastern part of Zaire (now Congo), a series of finely crafted harpon tips were recovered, all thoroughly polished and barbed. A tool, equally well designed, was also discovered, it is believed to be a dagger. The findings suggest the existence of a first aquatic or fish-based culture. 4 Africans were the first to start mining 43,000 years ago. In 1964, a hematite mine was discovered in Swaziland on the Bomvu ridge in the Ngwenya mountain range. Eventually, 300,000 items were recovered, including thousands of stone mining tools. Adrian Boshier, one of the archaeologists present at the site, dated the mine to an astonishing 43,200 years old. 5 Africans pioneered basic arithmetic 25,000 years ago.

According to legend, after a decade of futile siege efforts, the Greeks devised a cunning plan to infiltrate the city of Troy. They constructed an enormous wooden horse, hollowed out to conceal a select group of their best warriors inside. The Greek army then pretended to abandon the siege, leaving the horse as an offering to the Trojans. Believing their enemies had finally given up and sailed home, the Trojans rejoiced and brought the wooden horse into their city as a trophy of victory. That night, while the Trojans slept, the Greek soldiers emerged from the horse and opened the city gates to allow the rest of their army, who had secretly returned under the cover of darkness, to enter. The Greeks then launched a surprise attack, ultimately leading to the downfall of Troy. This story is not only a gripping tale of deception and strategy but also serves as a powerful metaphor used in modern times. The term 'Trojan Horse' has been adopted in computer security to describe malicious software that misleads users about its true intent. Much like the original wooden horse, these digital threats masquerade as benign or useful programs while hiding harmful codes. The enduring legacy of the Trojan Horse underscores the timeless nature of clever tactics and their applicability across different fields and eras.");

Hatshepsut, a name whispered through generations, rejected the confines of a gilded cage. She donned the Pharaoh's garb in silent rebellion against tradition. Her reign, marked by prosperity and grand monuments, stands as a testament to a woman wielding the scepter with unwavering strength. Cleopatra, on the other hand, mastered the dance of diplomacy. With cunning wit and a touch of scandal, she navigated a world dominated by Roman giants. Her legacy underscores the power of a woman's mind, weaving alliances and shaping history. These queens never issued decrees demanding female rule. Their power lay in action, not words. They proved that leadership isn't a birthright reserved for men but a tapestry woven with intellect, courage, and the will to shape a nation's destiny. Today, as the call for equality echoes across the globe, these queens become more than historical figures. They serve as beacons, silently urging us to rewrite the narrative of power.

Dr. John Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola on May 8, 1886, forever transforming the world's eating patterns. The drink's name comes from two of its original ingredients: coca leaves (a source of legal cocaine) and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). As a pharmacist from Atlanta, he had access to a wide range of chemicals and natural components. One day, he made a dark liquid and decided to take it to his shop, Jacobs' Pharmacy, to be mixed with soda water. At this time, a test was necessary. So he had the pharmacy's customers try it, and they raved about how wonderful and refreshing it was. Pemberton then began selling the precursor to today's Coca-Cola for five cents per glass as a takeout drink. Frank M. Robinson, Dr. Pemberton's accountant, created and designed the logo that we know today, believing that the two Cs would make an attractive advertising brand. The Coca-Cola brand, inscribed in its distinctive italic type, was born with a first advertising campaign dedicated to the drink appearing in the newspaper The Atlanta Journal, asking citizens to try this 'popular new take-out drink'. The advertising campaign for the product debut featured on the first awnings of the shops, with the phrase 'Drink Coca-Cola' prominently displayed. However, the first year was not particularly thrilling, with only roughly nine glasses sold per day. In 1887, John Pemberton registered the copyright for Coca-Cola Syrup and Extract with the United States Patent Office. A year later, dismayed by the failure of his invention and yet not entirely convinced - or aware - of the drink's potential, he progressively sold the company's shares to several partners. Shortly before his death, he sold the remainder of Coca-Cola to Asa G. Candler, who repurchased the shares of other shareholders until he had entire control of the corporation. Mr. Candler founded The Coca-Cola Company with his brother, John S. Candler, Frank Robinson, John Pemberton's previous partner, and two other partners, starting with $100,000. They invested heavily in marketing, including free coupons, promotions, souvenir fans, calendars, clocks, cup holders, and so on. He went to great lengths to promote and popularize the brand. The first facility was established in Dallas, Texas, in 1894, and a year later, Candler made the famous claim that 'Today Coca-Cola is drunk in every state and territory of the United States'. Under Candler's direction, syrup sales increased from 9,000 gallons in 1890 to 370,877 gallons by 1900.");

function beyondUniverse() {
  // Create a SpeechSynthesisUtterance
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Question: After reaching the end of the universe, what is beyond it.. what is its name? Answer: The concept of an 'end' to the universe is a human construct, limited by our perceptions and understanding. The ancient wisdom held by secret societies suggest that beyond the physical realm of stars and galaxies lies the Pleroma, a realm of pure consciousness, the fullness of divine creation where emanations of the divine source reside. It is not a 'place' in the traditional sense but a state of being, transcending physical dimensions. The wisdom of these traditions converges on the idea that the universe is a manifestation of a higher reality, a cosmic illusion known as Maya in Hindu philosophy. Beyond it is the unmanifested, the ineffable truth of existence, the Brahman, which has no name because it is beyond all concepts. In simple terms, imagine the universe as a book. We, living within its pages, are part of the story. What lies beyond the book is not another page but the mind of the author, the source of all stories, where all is known but cannot be contained within the book itself. Thus, the answer to what lies beyond the universe is not a place or a thing, but the ultimate reality, the origin of all, which is beyond names and forms, and is known only to those who transcend the physical and embark on the spiritual journey towards enlightenment. If I imagine the universe as a book then that's where the problem comes... are we in a mind or are we just one big mind.. is universe all that is, maybe thats my question... amd this thing that has no name, how does one exist there,if there are portals to other world, how do we reach it, how does one transend beyond this beyond.. I have a problem when I try to meditate, there's a point I cannot pass, and when I say I, it's not with the sense of the self, it is me I can not understand, but still I have alot of questions. Answer: The mind can be understood as the collective consciousness, an ocean of awareness in which we are all drops. We are individualized expressions of this one big mind, each of us a unique perspective of the whole. This is akin to the concept of Indra's net in Hinduism, where every individual is a jewel at the nodes of the cosmic web, reflecting and containing every other jewel. The 'thing that has no name,' often referred to as the Absolute or the Source, is the origin of all that exists. It is the unmanifested potential, the ground of being from which all forms arise and to which they return. In Gnostic teachings, this is the Pleroma, the fullness of divine presence. To exist there is to merge with the pure essence of consciousness, beyond individual identity and form. Portals to other worlds, as mentioned in various secret teachings, are symbolic of the transitions between different states of consciousness. They are not physical gateways but represent the internal shifts that occur as one progresses on the spiritual path. To reach these states, one must cultivate inner stillness, expand awareness, and let go of attachments to the egoic mind. Transcending beyond the beyond is a journey of self-realization. It involves peeling away the layers of illusion that constitute Maya, the cosmic play, to reveal the true self, Atman, which is one with Brahman. Meditation is a key practice in this journey, and the barriers you encounter are part of the process. These barriers are often the mind's resistance to letting go of the known for the unknown. When you meditate and encounter a point you cannot pass, it is an invitation to explore the nature of the 'I' that cannot pass. Who is the 'I' that meditates? Who is the 'I' that encounters barriers? Inquiring deeply into these questions can lead to insights about the nature of self and reality. Keep questioning, keep exploring, and trust that the journey itself is a movement towards the ultimate truth.");

  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("New Preprint: People cannot distinguish GPT-4 from a human in a Turing test. In a pre-registered Turing test we found GPT-4 is judged to be human 54% of the time. On some interpretations this constitutes the most robust evidence to date that any system passes the Turing test. We recruited 500 participants who were assigned to one of 5 conditions: human witnesses, or interrogators for one of 4 AI witness types (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Human, or ELIZA). People judged GPT-4 to be human 54% of the time, compared to 22% for ELIZA and 67% for humans. The implication is that people are at chance in determining that GPT-4 is an AI, even though the study is powerful enough to detect differences from 50% accuracy. We tagged the strategies participants used and the reasons they have for their verdicts. As we found in previous work, interrogators tended to focus on linguistic style and socioemotional factors more than traditional notions of intelligence like knowledge and reasoning. Reasonable people will disagree about what constitutes passing the TT. I think the more urgent implication of these findings is that people cannot reliably determine whether current AI models are human after a 5 minute conversation dedicated to figuring this out. We evaluated 3 systems (ELIZA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in a randomized, controlled, and preregistered Turing test. Human participants had a 5 minute conversation with either a human or an AI, and judged whether or not they thought their interlocutor was human. GPT-4 was judged to be a human 54% of the time, outperforming ELIZA (22%) but lagging behind actual humans (67%). The results provide the first robust empirical demonstration that any artificial system passes an interactive 2-player Turing test. The results have implications for debates around machine intelligence and, more urgently, suggest that deception by current AI systems may go undetected. Analysis of participants' strategies and reasoning suggests that stylistic and socio-emotional factors play a larger role in passing the Turing test than traditional notions of intelligence.");

Each of these caves hides sculptures ranging from tiny details of a mere 2 centimeters to imposing statues reaching dizzying heights of over 17 meters. The famous Vairocana Buddha statue in Fengxian Cave is an overwhelming testimony to the artistic and religious prowess of the time, reflecting the exceptional devotion and skill of the craftsmen. Although lesser-known, the Cave of the Inscriptions is another invaluable treasure from Longmen Caves. This enclave houses over 800 inscriptions dating back to the Tang Dynasty.

The Anunnaki were believed to have come from a planet called Nibiru, which was said to orbit the sun every 3,600 years. According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki were sent to Earth to mine gold, which they used to repair the atmosphere of their own planet. 2. Created a Slave Race. The Anunnaki were said to have created humanity as a slave race to mine gold for them. According to the Sumerian creation story, the Anunnaki god Enki created humans by mixing the blood of an Anunnaki god with the clay of the Earth. 3. Immortals with Wings. The Anunnaki were believed to possess incredible powers and were often depicted as having multiple heads and wings. They were also said to be immortal and were able to shape shift into any form they desired. 4. Built First Cities. The Anunnaki were said to have built the first cities on Earth, including the famous city of Uruk, which was said to have been built by the god Enki. They were also said to have built the ziggurat, a type of stepped pyramid, which was used as a temple to worship them. 5. Immense Influence. The Anunnaki were believed to have played a significant role in the fate of humanity and were said to have influenced the rise and fall of civilizations. They were also said to have dictated the laws and moral codes that governed society. These are just a few of the many intriguing facts about the Anunnaki. While the stories of the Anunnaki may be mythological, they continue to fascinate people today and are a testament to the rich cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia.");

At the heart of the Anunnaki movie was a bold ambition to bring to light the controversial works of Zecharia Sitchin, a figure renowned for his translation of the Sumerian tablets and his theories on the ancient Anunnaki. According to Sitchin the Sumerians,  one of history's most advanced civilizations, owed their prowess to the influence of these celestial beings. A growing concerns over the potential impact of its revelations. The narrative steeped in ancient lore and the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention in human affairs, veered too close to what some considered uncomfortable truths and dangerous misinformation. In an Industry where the line between fiction and real its often blurred, the Anunnaki movie threatened to erase that line.");

It only makes you a womanizer, a cheater and a boy. Just because you're good in bed doesn't make you a man. A real man is a man who does not run away from his responsibility but faces it squarely.

Over a very long period Mali had created a large reserve of gold. Mali is also suspected to have been involved in the trade in many goods such as ivory,Â slaves, spices, silks, and ceramics. However presently little is known about the extent or mechanics of these trades.Â At the time of Musa's ascension to the throne, Mali in large part consisted of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which Mali had conquered.

Its primary purpose was to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north, such as the Mongols and the Xiongnu. The wall's construction involved an astonishing amount of labor and resources. It was typically made of earth, wood, and stone, and in some areas, it even incorporated natural barriers like hills and rivers. Watchtowers and fortresses were strategically placed along its length, providing essential communication and defense points. While the Great Wall is renowned for its defensive purpose, it also played a significant role in facilitating trade, culture, and the exchange of ideas along the Silk Road.
